Looking perplexed, the grey-haired Hu was escorted from his seat next to President Xi Jinping and forcibly shuffled to the exit. The incident prompted waves of speculation. Had Hu been unwell? Or did Xi remove him in a visible display of power?</p><p>The episode came to mind via academic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/d7ab39fa-2363-46c0-97ca-1c12de485e8e\">Daniel Bell</a>’s <em>The Dean of Shandong</em>, an insightful memoir of the author’s time as an administrator at a Chinese university. Bell’s experiences lead him to muse on various aspects of Chinese bureaucratic power, one being why nearly all its leaders dye their hair black. And indeed, as Hu was led out of the room, his white flecks stood out jarringly against the jet-black plumage of the leaders around him.</p><p>“The basic idea is that black-haired rulers project an image of vigour and energy,” Bell writes, noting that this vigour is expected if one is to deliver good political outcomes. White hair, by contrast, “is a sign that one has left politics, either by force or voluntarily”. Xi himself is a very rare exception, sporting a few grey hairs almost as a signal that his sheer power allows him to ignore rules others must follow.</p><p>Bell is well-placed to observe such quirks. A Canadian political theorist, he spent his career studying Confucianism, a Chinese school of philosophy that promotes social harmony and supports merit-based public bureaucracies. Working in both western and Chinese universities, Bell won particular renown for defending China against its critics, notably in 2016’s <em>The China Model</em>, which backed picking leaders via exams and outcomes, not western-style elections.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/17b503fe-f324-416c-a88e-951d98d1ea1b\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content><p>Then, in 2017, Bell became dean at a public administration school in Shandong, the eastern province where Confucius was born — an unusual step given that few foreigners serve in Chinese bureaucracies. His latest book therefore has two aims: first to describe this unusual experience, and second to continue his earlier defence of China’s broader systems of government, albeit perhaps in more modest terms than his earlier works.</p><p>The first aim is pleasingly successful. Bell’s book is at times frank, perceptive and wryly amusing. He lists his many mis-steps navigating China’s bureaucratic norms. Early ambitions to establish a centre on Confucian thought came to naught. Bell occasionally drank too much, he admits. His marriage collapsed. He began dying his own hair too, but to no avail. “I just didn’t have the energy for the job”, he writes. “As my wife put it, I became the faculty panda.”</p><p>For all this his “confessions” are more personal than political, and Bell’s book is no <em>mea culpa</em> for his previous views. Nor does he pretend to be entirely impartial. Although not a member of China’s Communist party, he often uses “we” and “us” to describe his place in China’s system. And given the recent direction of Chinese high-level politics, even his more circumspect defence of China’s systems of public administration are often less than convincing.</p><p>This is true of his university experience. Bell clearly admires many of the officials he meets, noting they are hard-workers who seek to “serve the people”. Nonetheless the bureaucracy he describes is close to what a western liberal might fear. There are few rights or academic freedoms. Officials Bell dubs “political commissars” roam the corridors. Conferences are cancelled because they displease the powers that be. People watch their step.</p><pull-quote><pull-quote-text><p>There are few rights or academic freedoms. Officials Bell dubs ‘political commissars’ roam the corridors</p></pull-quote-text><pull-quote-source></pull-quote-source></pull-quote><p>The much harder job is defending China’s wider system under Xi. Here, Bell’s task is clearly more complex than in 2006, seven years before Xi became president, when he wrote <em>Beyond Liberal Democracy</em>, which argued for the moral legitimacy of East Asian alternatives to western liberalism. This is something he does admit: “When I look at some of the things I wrote in the past, I realise that I was much too naive in thinking that China would move toward a more humane political system,” he writes. Rather than Confucian values, it is Marxism that is now making a comeback, amid the genuine “possibility of a return to Maoist-style personal dictatorship”.</p><p>Bell has now left mainland China, having served his time in Shandong and moved to a university in Hong Kong. But his criticisms remain carefully caveated, as if his admiration for China’s people means he can’t quite bring himself to reject Xi’s authoritarian turn. This distinction between China’s people and its leaders is legitimate; indeed, it is one western leaders also often draw. But Bell’s warm feelings for China’s people and history leads him to be less critical of the country’s political direction than its circumstances would warrant.</p><p>Somewhat quixotically he ends up arguing that China needs to reinstate a form of “symbolic monarchy” as a limit on Xi’s executive power. It is an intriguing idea, albeit not a terribly realistic one, not least in an era in which Xi himself has close to monarchical powers.</p><p>All that said, Bell is right that western critics of China are often ignorant of the pros and cons of China’s system. Those who know the country well, and especially those like Bell who write about it with wit and insight, deserve to be listened to. A red mist of anti-China feeling increasingly blinds the west to the many strengths of the Chinese system. But a similar bias is true for China’s few remaining admirers in the west too, as they struggle to come to terms with what that same Chinese system has now become.</p><p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/41sd1p7\"><strong>The Dean of Shandong</strong></a><strong>: Confessions of a Minor Bureaucrat at a Chinese University</strong>, by Daniel Bell, <em>Princeton University Press $27.95/£22.00, 208 pages</em></p><p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p></body>",
