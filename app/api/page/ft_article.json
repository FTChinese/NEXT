The difference would have been even starker, he adds, if another peninsula favourite, the previously two-hatted Laura at Point Leo Estate, had not been closed for most of 2022 because of a fire.</p><p>“The peninsula is already well known among wine lovers, but it is only just starting to get the recognition it deserves for its dining and all the other things, like the coastlines and fantastic golf courses, hot springs and sculpture parks,” he says. “It’s still a bit of a hidden gem compared to regions like Yarra Valley, Margaret River and the Barossa.”</p><p>Mornington Peninsula’s mix of sheltered bay beaches and wilder surf coast make it an ideal holiday destination, but with water on three sides, it has a cool maritime climate, with mild temperatures in summer and winter, which is unique for an Australian wine region. About three-quarters of the area’s vines are Pinot Noir or Chardonnay, known for their freshness and balance, while aromatic grapes such as Pinot Gris are gaining ground. Variety comes from the differing soils and elevation of rolling volcanic hills.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/e09a0153-9619-47a1-942e-83c0902c8ef0\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content><p>A history of small land holdings means any use of these fertile soils has been on a small scale, whether it be dairy production, growing stone fruit or winemaking, with family businesses dominating. “That has led to a big focus on driving quality,” says Spedding. “It is simply too expensive to drive scale here, so it has to be a high-value-added product to make it work.”</p><p>Peninsula wineries were first commended in a London contest in 1886, but most vines were abandoned for vegetable growing in the 1920s, and apple orchards were predominant for the greater part of the 20th century. The first new vineyards emerged in the 1970s, followed by rapid growth in winemaking in the mid-1990s. There are now 200-plus vineyards, with at least 50 offering cellar-door tastings and direct sales to customers.</p><p>At the start of this century, only a few offered food with their wine tastings, but there is now a focus on offering broader experiences with a mix of local produce, wine and scenery. </p><p>Apart from wineries, the peninsula is also home to a plethora of breweries, distilleries, cheese and olive producers, accommodation options and highly rated restaurants such as the two-hatted <a href=\"https://www.tedesca.com.au/osteria-tedesca\">Tedesca Osteria</a> in Red Hill and <a href=\"https://thecontinentalsorrento.com.au\">Audrey’s</a> (one hat) at the Continental Sorrento, a clifftop hotel that dates from 1875 but reopened last year as a glitzy member of the IHG group. </p><p><strong>Getting there</strong></p><p>Helicopter rides are available from the Yarra River in the centre of Melbourne, but you will still need a car to really take in the peninsula. Driving is best as it is just 75km or an hour’s drive south-east of the city centre.  </p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Content\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/13329104\" alt=\"Map locating the gastronomic glories of the Mornington Peninsula\" data-asset-type=\"flourish\" data-embedded=\"true\" data-flourish-type=\"visualisation\" data-layout-width=\"full-grid\" data-time-stamp=\"\" id=\"13329104\"></ft-content><hr/><h2>1.

Oddly enough, it is not on Jetty Road at all, instead tucked away in the industrial zone at the back of Dromana. (Don’t ask, but we suspect it has something to do with investing in the brand before tying down the lease on the intended site).</p><p>Concrete floors and a factory decor fit well with the large viewing window through to the brewery vats, while the super-casual atmosphere is helped by an indie acoustic soundtrack and occasionally live music.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/26a6df99-454b-41d4-a260-5803f2918a06\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content><p>The brewery is known for a pale ale that is distributed throughout Australia but it also has an adventurous repertoire, ranging from a successful pale wheat beer (3.5 per cent ABV) to a passion fruit mojito sour  (4 per cent), a pineapple sour that doesn’t quite work (4.2 per cent), a mango session IPA (5 per cent) and a meatier Infinite 8 IPA (8.8 per cent).</p><p>A group of diners can happily fill a table with a selection of salads, fried cauliflower or chicken, calamari, a few burgers and perhaps a sharing board for two of 1kg of slow-cooked lamb shoulder with pumpkin salad and Turkish bread, topping it all off with some tasting flight boards of four different beers.</p><p>A membership programme offers discounts to regulars, and the brewery works with other small local firms to try to build a regional reputation.</p><p>“It’s not like Melbourne, with a million competitors,” says Emily Walker, the 30-year-old assistant venue manager. “It’s a small community down here, and we all win if people realise there is more than one great venue down here.” <a href=\"https://www.jettyroad.com.au\"><em><strong>Website</strong></em></a><em><strong>; </strong></em><a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jetty+Road+Brewery/@-38.3366032,144.9887271,14.87z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x6ad5c5a347fd2feb:0x65282f8d85693aee!8m2!3d-38.3320465!4d144.987442!16s%2Fg%2F11f3m7l5w4!5m1!1e1\"><em><strong>Directions</strong></em></a></p><p><em>Which winery or brewery restaurants on the Mornington Peninsula would you recommend?
