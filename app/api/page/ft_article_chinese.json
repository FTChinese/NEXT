    "bodyXML": "<body><p>As Jay Powell faced reporters on Wednesday following the US Federal Reserve’s first policy meeting of 2024, his mood was confident. </p><p>Hailing “six months of good inflation” and predicting more to come, the Fed chair <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20240131.pdf\">said</a>: “Let’s be honest: this is a good economy.”</p><p>Maybe a little too good. On Friday, markets were stunned by a Bureau of Labor Statistics release that showed the US economy added 353,000 jobs in January — almost double what was expected. </p><p>A March cut to interest rates — already described as unlikely by Powell — was instantly ruled out on Wall Street as a result of the blowout employment data. </p><p>Central bankers around the world had begun preparing for rate cuts on the back of steadily weakening inflation. But as the US jobs numbers demonstrate, hot labour markets are the biggest potential barrier to them hitting their 2 per cent inflation goals. </p><p>Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, says Friday’s data made declaring victory against inflation “a much more fraught” decision for central banks. “The reality is that, with these pressures, it’s going to be very difficult to keep inflation contained unless productivity growth remains strong.” </p><p>This is not to deny how dramatic the improvements in the inflation picture have been. A year ago, the Fed and its counterparts were in the midst of a brutal series of interest-rate increases that some feared would drive economies into recession. </p><p>Powell warned in February 2023 that officials still had a “long way to go” as they attempted to quell the “significant hardship” imposed by the highest inflation in 40 years. Since then, inflation has tumbled towards the Fed’s 2 per cent target across an array of different gauges. </p><p>In Frankfurt, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, on January 25 sounded similarly positive about the eurozone picture as she declared the “disinflation process” to be at work; headline price growth in the bloc is now 2.8 per cent, not far from the ECB’s 2 per cent target. </p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Content\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/16674684\" alt=\"\" data-asset-type=\"flourish\" data-embedded=\"true\" data-flourish-type=\"visualisation\" data-layout-width=\"\" data-time-stamp=\"\" id=\"16674684\"></ft-content><p>Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, told reporters in London last Thursday that he was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f6d7cf9-eeb9-45da-a677-39f94ed6ccd3\">seeing </a>“good news on inflation” after price growth in the UK more halved in the space of six months, to 4 per cent. </p><p>The speed of the retreat in inflation over recent months has wrongfooted many rate-setters. Consumer price growth across advanced economies has dropped from more than 7 per cent in 2022 to 4.6 per cent in 2023, according to the IMF. </p><p>Forecasts from the fund last week pointed to a further decline to just 2.6 per cent this year — sharply below its previous 3 per cent prediction — with four-fifths of the economies it tracks set to experience lower annual headline and core inflation in 2024.  </p><p>Mahmood Pradhan, head of global macroeconomics at the Amundi Investment Institute, argues the trend in inflation is now “decisively down and it is just a question of time before we see substantial rate cuts this year”.</p><p>He added: “Central bankers out of caution want to wait a bit longer, but I can see the Fed, ECB and Bank of England all cutting in the middle of this year.”</p><hr/><p><strong>Continued progress in </strong>this disinflation story will hinge heavily on the fate of labour markets. While the initial declines in inflation were driven by external factors, progress now depends on the more difficult task of depressing domestically generated price growth. That will be harder if jobs and wage growth stay too robust. </p><p>Economists say squeezing out the last vestiges of excess price growth might require policymakers to maintain persistently tough policy that further depresses demand.</p><p>It all speaks to a concern that has been haunting central bankers for months: will the “last mile” of the effort to drive price growth down to their 2 per cent targets prove to be the most difficult? If it does, central banks will have to be particularly patient before cutting rates. </p><p>Among the major central banks, officials at the Fed have consistently appeared the least concerned about the difficulties of getting through that final stage of the inflation-fighting journey. </p><pull-quote><pull-quote-text><p>Productivity continues to look really good. The US economy can tolerate higher wages</p></pull-quote-text><pull-quote-source></pull-quote-source></pull-quote><p>Powell himself sounded sceptical about the notion in December. “Inflation keeps coming down,” he said. “It’s so far, so good — although we kind of assume that it will get harder from here. But so far, it hasn’t.”</p><p>The Fed’s confidence owes something to both the nature of US inflation and the pace of its descent. While the US was hard hit by Covid-related disruption to supply chains, it did not see the sort of surge in energy prices that drove up prices across Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As a result, US inflation never reached double digits, peaking at 9.1 per cent in 2022. </p><p>The nature of its inflation shock also made its reversal more swift. On some measures — including a six-month gauge of core personal consumption expenditures, a measure that Fed officials say offers the best signal of underlying price pressures — inflation is now under 2 per cent. </p><p>But worries about an overheating jobs market re-emerged with a vengeance on Friday. In addition to the blowout January numbers, figures for December and November were revised upwards and average hourly earnings increased by 4.5 per cent, according to the labour bureau. </p><p>Diane Swonk, US chief economist at KPMG, says unusually low levels of lay-offs and a drop in hours worked suggested that some of the job market’s strength was due to employers “hoarding” labour. Those who struggled to hire workers after Covid lockdowns ended did not want to find themselves in the same position when demand picked up, she explains.</p><p>“However, that is still a lot more paychecks to start the year than usual,” she adds. “When taken with the upward revisions to the previous two months and the hotter than expected wage growth, that suggests the labour market may be re-accelerating.” </p><big-number><big-number-headline>3.3%</big-number-headline><big-number-intro>Growth rate of the US economy in the fourth quarter</big-number-intro></big-number><p>Curt Covington, a senior director at AgAmerica Lending, a credit provider to farmers, says wage pressures remain high in states such as California, where the statewide minimum wage has risen by another 50 cents to $16 an hour this year — up from $12 an hour when the pandemic struck. </p><p>“The [production of] certain commodities is very labour driven, speciality crops in particular,” says Covington. “You don’t see much of the increase in labour costs on Midwest crops like corn and beans, but when you get into speciality crops such as some fruits and vegetables, the labour cost has gone up significantly.”</p><p>Some economists worry that the deflation in goods prices caused by the easing of supply chain pressures will soon come to an end, making the job of suppressing overall price growth yet harder. This is especially relevant given strong US demand, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter. </p><p>Pradhan argued that stubbornly high wage growth represents the main question mark for central bankers as they prepare for the “last mile” of the disinflation journey. </p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Content\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/16674258\" alt=\"\" data-asset-type=\"flourish\" data-embedded=\"true\" data-flourish-type=\"visualisation\" data-layout-width=\"\" data-time-stamp=\"\" id=\"16674258\"></ft-content><p>But he remains sanguine. US wage growth should prove benign because it is supported by strong productivity growth, he argues. In Europe, weak economic demand should lead to “continued moderation”. </p><p>Others note that the situation facing the Fed is very different from the dreaded wage-price spiral seen during the 1970s and early 1980s. “This spell of inflation hasn’t primarily been about demand. It’s been about disruptions to supply chains, labour markets, and spending caused by Covid,” says Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and founder of Sahm Consulting. </p><p>“Productivity continues to look really good,” she adds. “The US economy can tolerate higher wages.” </p><hr/><p><strong>At the European Central Bank</strong>, rate-setters have made it clear that their key focus in the coming months will be on wage settlements and whether they are compatible with the 2 per cent inflation target. </p><p>Back in December, German central bank boss Joachim Nagel warned inflation was “a stubborn, greedy beast” and that bringing it down would require “gritting your teeth and not letting up”. More recently Nagel has sounded somewhat more optimistic, telling an event in Berlin last week that the beast had been “tamed”. </p><p>But Lagarde has been warning it is “premature” to even discuss possible interest rate cuts at this stage — critically because of rising wages. The worry at the ECB and elsewhere is that workers will demand big pay rises to restore the purchasing power they lost during the initial spikes in prices. As that increased spending power finds its way into the economy, it triggers a fresh surge in prices.</p><p>Eurozone wages rose over 5 per cent last year, close to the annual inflation rate. While recent data shows wage pressure is “already declining”, Lagarde said the ECB still wants to be sure that higher labour costs are “sufficiently absorbed” by companies choosing to reduce their profit margins rather than raising their prices.</p><p>Eurozone inflation has fallen steadily from a record 10.6 per cent in late 2022 to below 3 per cent, but Lagarde has expressed concern that one area where prices seem stickier is the services sector, where labour makes up a large share of total costs. Eurozone services prices rose 4 per cent in the year to January for the third consecutive month.</p><p>As in the US, those worries are underpinned by the unexpected resilience of the region’s labour market. Eurozone unemployment remained at a record low of 6.4 per cent in December and many companies — particularly in the services sector — are still complaining that labour shortages are the main constraint on production.</p><big-number><big-number-headline>6.4%</big-number-headline><big-number-intro>Eurozone unemployment in December, a record low</big-number-intro></big-number><p>But as in the US, optimistic economists dismiss the idea that Europe is on the cusp of a wage-price spiral, pointing out that the automatic “indexation” of pay to prices has largely disappeared except for in a few countries, such as Belgium.</p><p>A key difference with previous periods of high inflation is that wages seem to be following prices rather than leading them, according to Sven Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. “It is natural that when you have a supply shock which pushes up prices, it has a lagging impact on wages, but the risk here isn’t that great,” he says.</p><p>Even though labour markets are tight, it may be hard for many companies to pass on higher wage costs because — unlike the US — underlying economies are stagnating. So although unions last week demanded a pay rise of 6 to 7 per cent for German chemical workers, this seems unlikely to trigger a price surge in a sector that suffered an 11 per cent fall in production last year.</p><p>“A one-off rise in wages is very different from a spiral,” says Marcel Fratzscher, a former ECB official now running the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. “The ECB should look through a one-off adjustment.” </p><pull-quote><pull-quote-text><p>A one-off rise in wages is very different from a spiral. The ECB should look through a one-off adjustment</p></pull-quote-text><pull-quote-source></pull-quote-source></pull-quote><p>In private, ECB rate-setters say they feeling confident. “We see indicators moving in the right direction,” says one of its governing council members. “Monetary policy is working. Inflation is falling.” </p><p>Officials at the Bank of England are not sounding quite that assured — or at least not yet. While Bailey finally opened the door to lower interest rates last week after his policy committee kept rates pegged at 5.25 per cent, the BoE governor appeared to tip-toe around the topic of rate cuts, as if mentioning the idea out loud would prompt unwarranted relief in markets. </p><p>While the UK labour market had cooled, it remains “tight by historical standards”, the bank warned, as it continued to highlight indicators of persistent price pressures including wage growth and services inflation. A survey by BoE regional agents showed that pay settlements will fall to an average of 5.4 per cent this year, a figure that is not far below last year’s 6 per cent.</p><hr/><p><strong>Worries about other</strong> “upside risks” to inflation have added to central bankers’ caution. One obvious one stems from the continuing conflicts in the Middle East; the disruption to shipping from attacks by Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea is widely cited as a factor that could push inflation higher than expected. Europe appears particularly exposed given the importance of the trade route for imports from China.</p><p>However, rate-setters including Lagarde of the ECB have tended to downplay that issue, pointing out that shipping made up only 1.5 per cent of the total cost of goods. Economists seem to agree. Goldman has estimated the rise in container shipping rates will add only 0.1 percentage points to global inflation.</p><p>Even the ECB’s new artificial intelligence-powered model for forecasting inflation shows it is set to fall much closer to 2 per cent by this summer than the central bank forecast only a few weeks ago. </p><p>Nevertheless, banks will probably remain wary of jumping too soon and then being forced to abruptly reverse course if inflation takes flight again. The IMF itself warned last year that there is a prodigiously rich history of central banks prematurely declaring victory over inflation.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Content\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/16674166\" alt=\"\" data-asset-type=\"flourish\" data-embedded=\"true\" data-flourish-type=\"visualisation\" data-layout-width=\"\" data-time-stamp=\"\" id=\"16674166\"></ft-content><p>That includes the US itself, where Federal Reserve chair Arthur Burns was accused of being far too relaxed about price growth in the early 1970s — failing to get to grips with a scourge that plagued the US economy for an entire decade.</p><p>The rapid reversal of supply-driven inflation juxtaposed with stubborn domestic price growth leaves central bankers facing a delicate balancing act, says Krishna Guha, a former Federal Reserve official who is now vice-chair of investment bank Evercore-ISI.</p><p>“You want to make sure that you don’t jeopardise the soft landing by keeping policy too tight for too long,” he says. “The job isn’t quite done yet, but they are reasonably close — in some cases very close — to having pulled this off.”</p><p>Sahm is more confident, saying the market has “had months of good data on prices.”</p><p>“This [January] jobs report doesn’t change the fact that it’s going to turn out to be the first mile that was the toughest, not the last.”</p><p><em>Data visualisation by </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/keith-fray\"><em>Keith Fray</em></a></p></body>",

        "bodyXML": "<p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-0\">As Jay Powell faced reporters on Wednesday following the US Federal Reserve’s first policy meeting of 2024, his mood was confident.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-1\">Hailing “six months of good inflation” and predicting more to come, the Fed chair <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20240131.pdf\">said</a>: “Let’s be honest: this is a good economy.”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-2\">Maybe a little too good. On Friday, markets were stunned by a Bureau of Labor Statistics release that showed the US economy added 353,000 jobs in January — almost double what was expected.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-3\">A March cut to interest rates — already described as unlikely by Powell — was instantly ruled out on Wall Street as a result of the blowout employment data. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-4\">Central bankers around the world had begun preparing for rate cuts on the back of steadily weakening inflation. But as the US jobs numbers demonstrate, hot labour markets are the biggest potential barrier to them hitting their 2 per cent inflation goals.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-5\">Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University, says Friday’s data made declaring victory against inflation “a much more fraught” decision for central banks. “The reality is that, with these pressures, it’s going to be very difficult to keep inflation contained unless productivity growth remains strong.” </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-6\">This is not to deny how dramatic the improvements in the inflation picture have been. A year ago, the Fed and its counterparts were in the midst of a brutal series of interest-rate increases that some feared would drive economies into recession. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-7\">Powell warned in February 2023 that officials still had a “long way to go” as they attempted to quell the “significant hardship” imposed by the highest inflation in 40 years. Since then, inflation has tumbled towards the Fed’s 2 per cent target across an array of different gauges. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-8\">In Frankfurt, Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, on January 25 sounded similarly positive about the eurozone picture as she declared the “disinflation process” to be at work; headline price growth in the bloc is now 2.8 per cent, not far from the ECB’s 2 per cent target. </p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/16674684?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-9\">Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, told reporters in London last Thursday that he was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f6d7cf9-eeb9-45da-a677-39f94ed6ccd3\">seeing </a>“good news on inflation” after price growth in the UK more halved in the space of six months, to 4 per cent. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-10\">The speed of the retreat in inflation over recent months has wrongfooted many rate-setters. Consumer price growth across advanced economies has dropped from more than 7 per cent in 2022 to 4.6 per cent in 2023, according to the IMF. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-11\">Forecasts from the fund last week pointed to a further decline to just 2.6 per cent this year — sharply below its previous 3 per cent prediction — with four-fifths of the economies it tracks set to experience lower annual headline and core inflation in 2024. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-12\">Mahmood Pradhan, head of global macroeconomics at the Amundi Investment Institute, argues the trend in inflation is now “decisively down and it is just a question of time before we see substantial rate cuts this year”.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-13\">He added: “Central bankers out of caution want to wait a bit longer, but I can see the Fed, ECB and Bank of England all cutting in the middle of this year.”</p><hr><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-14\"><strong>Continued progress in </strong>this disinflation story will hinge heavily on the fate of labour markets. While the initial declines in inflation were driven by external factors, progress now depends on the more difficult task of depressing domestically generated price growth. That will be harder if jobs and wage growth stay too robust. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-15\">Economists say squeezing out the last vestiges of excess price growth might require policymakers to maintain persistently tough policy that further depresses demand.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-16\">It all speaks to a concern that has been haunting central bankers for months: will the “last mile” of the effort to drive price growth down to their 2 per cent targets prove to be the most difficult? If it does, central banks will have to be particularly patient before cutting rates.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-17\">Among the major central banks, officials at the Fed have consistently appeared the least concerned about the difficulties of getting through that final stage of the inflation-fighting journey. </p><blockquote class=\"n-content-pullquote\"><div class=\"n-content-pullquote__content\"><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-18\">Productivity continues to look really good. The US economy can tolerate higher wages</p><footer class=\"n-content-pullquote__footer\"></footer></div></blockquote><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-19\">Powell himself sounded sceptical about the notion in December.&nbsp;“Inflation keeps coming down,” he said. “It’s so far, so good — although we kind of assume that it will get harder from here. But so far, it hasn’t.”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-20\">The Fed’s confidence owes something to both the nature of US inflation and the pace of its descent. While the US was hard hit by Covid-related disruption to supply chains, it did not see the sort of surge in energy prices that drove up prices across Europe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;As a result, US inflation never reached double digits, peaking at 9.1 per cent in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-21\">The nature of its inflation shock also made its reversal more swift. On some measures — including a six-month gauge of core personal consumption expenditures, a measure that Fed officials say offers the best signal of underlying price pressures — inflation is now under 2 per cent.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-22\">But worries about an overheating jobs market re-emerged with a vengeance on Friday. In addition to the blowout January numbers, figures for December and November were revised upwards and average hourly earnings increased by 4.5 per cent, according to the labour bureau. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-23\">Diane Swonk, US chief economist at KPMG, says unusually low levels of lay-offs and a drop in hours worked suggested that some of the job market’s strength was due to employers “hoarding” labour. Those who struggled to hire workers after Covid lockdowns ended did not want to find themselves in the same position when demand picked up, she explains.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-24\">“However, that is still a lot more paychecks to start the year than usual,” she adds. “When taken with the upward revisions to the previous two months and the hotter than expected wage growth, that suggests the labour market may be re-accelerating.” </p><div class=\"n-content-big-number\"><span class=\"n-content-big-number__title is-text-only\" id=\"id-25\">3.3%</span><span class=\"n-content-big-number__content is-text-only\" id=\"id-26\">Growth rate of the US economy in the fourth quarter</span></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-27\">Curt Covington, a senior director at AgAmerica Lending, a credit provider to farmers, says wage pressures remain high in states such as California, where the statewide minimum wage has risen by another 50 cents to $16 an hour this year — up from $12 an hour when the pandemic struck.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-28\">“The [production of] certain commodities is very labour driven, speciality crops in particular,” says Covington. “You don’t see much of the increase in labour costs on Midwest crops like corn and beans, but when you get into speciality crops such as some fruits and vegetables, the labour cost has gone up significantly.”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-29\">Some economists worry that the deflation in goods prices caused by the easing of supply chain pressures will soon come to an end, making the job of suppressing overall price growth yet harder. This is especially relevant given strong US demand, with the economy expanding at an annualised rate of 3.3 per cent in the fourth quarter.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-30\">Pradhan argued that stubbornly high wage growth represents the main question mark for central bankers as they prepare for the “last mile” of the disinflation journey. </p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/16674258?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-31\">But he remains sanguine. US wage growth should prove benign because it is supported by strong productivity growth, he argues. In Europe, weak economic demand should lead to “continued moderation”. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-32\">Others note that the situation facing the Fed is very different from the dreaded wage-price spiral seen during the 1970s and early 1980s.&nbsp;“This spell of inflation hasn’t primarily&nbsp;been about demand. It’s been about disruptions to&nbsp;supply chains, labour markets, and spending caused by Covid,” says Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist and founder of Sahm Consulting. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-33\">“Productivity continues to look really good,” she adds. “The US economy can tolerate higher wages.” </p><hr><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-34\"><strong>At the European Central Bank</strong>, rate-setters have made it clear that their key focus in the coming months will be on wage settlements and whether they are compatible with the 2 per cent inflation target. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-35\">Back in December, German central bank boss Joachim Nagel warned inflation was “a stubborn, greedy beast” and that bringing it down would require “gritting your teeth and not letting up”.&nbsp;More recently Nagel has sounded somewhat more optimistic, telling an event in Berlin last week that the beast had been “tamed”. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-36\">But Lagarde has been warning it is “premature” to even discuss possible interest rate cuts at this stage — critically because of rising wages. The worry at the ECB and elsewhere is that workers will demand big pay rises to restore the purchasing power they lost during the initial spikes in prices. As that increased spending power finds its way into the economy, it triggers a fresh surge in prices.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-37\">Eurozone wages rose over 5 per cent last year, close to the annual inflation rate. While recent data shows wage pressure is “already declining”, Lagarde said the ECB still wants to be sure that higher labour costs are “sufficiently absorbed” by companies choosing to reduce their profit margins rather than raising their prices.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-38\">Eurozone inflation has fallen steadily from a record 10.6 per cent in late 2022 to below 3 per cent, but Lagarde has expressed concern that one area where prices seem stickier is the services sector, where labour makes up a large share of total costs. Eurozone services prices rose 4 per cent in the year to January for the third consecutive month.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-39\">As in the US, those worries are underpinned by the unexpected resilience of the region’s labour market. Eurozone unemployment remained at a record low of 6.4 per cent in December and many companies — particularly in the services sector — are still complaining that labour shortages are the main constraint on production.</p><div class=\"n-content-big-number\"><span class=\"n-content-big-number__title is-text-only\" id=\"id-40\">6.4%</span><span class=\"n-content-big-number__content is-text-only\" id=\"id-41\">Eurozone unemployment in December, a record low</span></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-42\">But as in the US, optimistic economists dismiss the idea that Europe is on the cusp of a wage-price spiral, pointing out that the automatic “indexation” of pay to prices has largely disappeared except for in a few countries, such as Belgium.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-43\">A key difference with previous periods of high inflation is that wages seem to be following prices rather than leading them, according to Sven Jari Stehn, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. “It is natural that when you have a supply shock which pushes up prices, it has a lagging impact on wages, but the risk here isn’t that great,” he says.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-44\">Even though labour markets are tight, it may be hard for many companies to pass on higher wage costs because — unlike the US — underlying economies are stagnating. So although unions last week demanded a pay rise of 6 to 7 per cent for German chemical workers, this seems unlikely to trigger a price surge in a sector that suffered an 11 per cent fall in production last year.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-45\">“A one-off rise in wages is very different from a spiral,” says Marcel Fratzscher, a former ECB official now running the German Institute for Economic Research in Berlin. “The ECB should look through a one-off adjustment.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote class=\"n-content-pullquote\"><div class=\"n-content-pullquote__content\"><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-46\">A one-off rise in wages is very different from a spiral. The ECB should look through a one-off adjustment</p><footer class=\"n-content-pullquote__footer\"></footer></div></blockquote><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-47\">In private, ECB rate-setters say they feeling confident. “We see indicators moving in the right direction,” says one of its governing council members. “Monetary policy is working. Inflation is falling.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-48\">Officials at the Bank of England are not sounding quite that assured — or at least not yet. While Bailey finally opened the door to lower interest rates last week after his policy committee kept rates pegged at 5.25 per cent, the BoE governor appeared to tip-toe around the topic of rate cuts, as if mentioning the idea out loud would prompt unwarranted relief in markets.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-49\">While the UK labour market had cooled, it remains “tight by historical standards”, the bank warned, as it continued to highlight indicators of persistent price pressures including wage growth and services inflation. A survey by BoE regional agents showed that pay settlements will fall to an average of 5.4 per cent this year, a figure that is not far below last year’s 6 per cent.</p><hr><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-50\"><strong>Worries about other</strong> “upside risks” to inflation have added to central bankers’ caution. One obvious one stems from the continuing conflicts in the Middle East; the disruption to shipping from attacks by Houthi rebels on vessels in the Red Sea is widely cited as a factor that could push inflation higher than expected.&nbsp;Europe appears particularly exposed given the importance of the trade route for imports from China.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-51\">However, rate-setters including Lagarde of the ECB have tended to downplay that issue, pointing out that shipping made up only 1.5 per cent of the total cost of goods. Economists seem to agree. Goldman has estimated the rise in container shipping rates will add only 0.1 percentage points to global inflation.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-52\">Even the ECB’s new artificial intelligence-powered model for forecasting inflation shows it is set to fall much closer to 2 per cent by this summer than the central bank forecast only a few weeks ago. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-53\">Nevertheless, banks will probably remain wary of jumping too soon and then being forced to abruptly reverse course if inflation takes flight again. The IMF itself warned last year that there is a prodigiously rich history of central banks prematurely declaring victory over inflation.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/16674166?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-54\">That includes the US itself, where Federal Reserve chair Arthur Burns was accused of being far too relaxed about price growth in the early 1970s — failing to get to grips with a scourge that plagued the US economy for an entire decade.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-55\">The rapid reversal of supply-driven inflation juxtaposed with stubborn domestic price growth leaves central bankers facing a delicate balancing act, says Krishna Guha, a former Federal Reserve official who is now vice-chair of investment bank Evercore-ISI.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-56\">“You want to make sure that you don’t jeopardise the soft landing by keeping policy too tight for too long,” he says. “The job isn’t quite done yet, but they are reasonably close — in some cases very close — to having pulled this off.”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-57\">Sahm is more confident, saying the market has “had months of good data on prices.”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-58\">“This [January] jobs report doesn’t change the fact that it’s going to turn out to be the first mile that was the toughest, not the last.”</p><p><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-59\">Data visualisation by </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/keith-fray\"><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-60\">Keith Fray</em></a></p>",
        "bodyXMLTranslation": "<p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-0\">在2024年美联储(US Federal Reserve)首次政策会议后，杰伊•鲍威尔(Jay Powell)面对记者时表现得自信。</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-1\">美联储主席称赞“六个月的良好通胀”并预测未来会有更多，<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20240131.pdf\">他说</a>：“坦率地说：这是一个好的经济。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-2\">或许有点太好了。上周五，劳工统计局(Bureau of Labor Statistics)发布的数据让市场大为震惊，数据显示美国经济在1月份增加了35.3万个就业岗位，几乎是预期的两倍。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-3\">由于就业数据的惊人表现，华尔街立即排除了对利率进行3月份的降息，而鲍威尔已经表示这种可能性很小。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-4\">全球各国央行已经开始为通胀持续走弱做准备，准备降息。但正如美国就业数据所显示的那样，炙手可热的劳动力市场是实现2%通胀目标的最大潜在障碍。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-5\">康奈尔大学(Cornell University)的经济学家埃斯瓦尔•普拉萨德(Eswar Prasad)表示，周五的数据使得中央银行在宣布对抗通胀取得胜利时变得“更加棘手事实是，面对这些压力，要想控制通胀将会非常困难，除非生产率增长保持强劲。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-6\">这并不否认通胀形势的改善是多么戏剧性。一年前，美联储及其同行正在进行一系列残酷的加息，一些人担心这将导致经济陷入衰退。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-7\">鲍威尔在2023年2月警告称，官员们在试图缓解40年来最高通胀所带来的“重大困难”时仍有“很长的路要走”。此后，通胀率在各种不同的指标下逐渐降至美联储2%的目标水平。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-8\">1月25日，欧洲央行(European Central Bank)主席克里斯蒂娜•拉加德(Christine Lagarde)在法兰克福表示，欧元区的形势同样积极，她宣布“通缩过程”正在进行中；该地区的总体物价增长率现在为2.8%，离欧洲央行的2%目标不远。</p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/16674684?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-9\">英格兰银行行长安德鲁•贝利(Andrew Bailey)上周四在伦敦告诉记者，英国的<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f6d7cf9-eeb9-45da-a677-39f94ed6ccd3\">通胀情况出现了“好消息”</a>，因为英国的物价增长在六个月内减少了一半，降至4%。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-10\">通胀在最近几个月的回落速度出乎许多利率制定者的意料。根据国际货币基金组织(IMF)的数据，发达经济体的消费者物价增长从2022年的7%以上降至2023年的4.6%。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-11\">上周该基金的预测显示，今年的增长率将进一步下降至仅为2.6%，大幅低于其之前的3%预测。该基金追踪的四分之四的经济体预计将在2024年经历年度总体和核心通胀率下降。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-12\">东方汇理(Amundi)投资研究所全球宏观经济学负责人马哈茂德•普拉丹(Mahmood Pradhan)认为，通胀趋势已经“明确下行，只是时间问题，今年我们将看到大幅降息。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-13\">他补充道：“出于谨慎，全球各国央行希望再等一段时间，但我可以看到美联储、欧洲央行和英国银行都会在今年年中降息。”</p><hr><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-14\"><strong>这种通缩情况的持续进展将严重依赖于劳动力市场的命运。</strong>虽然最初的通胀下降是由外部因素驱动的，但进展现在取决于更加困难的任务，即抑制国内产生的价格增长。如果就业和工资增长保持过于强劲，这将更加困难。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-15\">经济学家表示，消除最后一丝过度价格增长可能需要决策者坚持实施进一步抑制需求的严格政策。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-16\">这一切都表明了央行多个月来一直担心的问题：将通胀率推至2%目标的“最后一英里”是否会变得最困难？如果是这样，央行在降息之前将需要特别耐心。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-17\">在各大中央银行中，美联储的官员似乎一直最不担心通过通胀抗争旅程的最后阶段所面临的困难。</p><blockquote class=\"n-content-pullquote\"><div class=\"n-content-pullquote__content\"><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-18\">生产力继续保持良好。美国经济可以承受更高的工资</p><footer class=\"n-content-pullquote__footer\"></footer></div></blockquote><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-19\">鲍威尔本人在12月对这个观点表示怀疑。“通胀一直在下降，”他说。“目前为止，一切都还好——尽管我们有点假设从现在开始会变得更困难。但到目前为止，还没有。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-20\">美联储(The Fed)的信心部分归功于美国通胀的性质和下降的速度。虽然美国受到了与Covid相关的供应链中断的严重打击，但并没有像俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后欧洲那样出现能源价格的激增，导致价格上涨。因此，美国的通胀从未达到两位数，2022年达到了9.1%的峰值。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-21\">通胀冲击的性质也使其逆转更加迅速。根据一些指标，包括六个月核心个人消费支出的衡量标准，这是美联储官员表示最能反映潜在价格压力的指标，通胀现在低于2%。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-22\">然而，对于就业市场过热的担忧在上周五再次浮现。除了1月份的惊人数据外，12月和11月的数据也被上调，而根据劳工局的数据，平均每小时工资增长了4.5%。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-23\">毕马威(KPMG)的美国首席经济学家黛安•斯旺克(Diane Swonk)表示，异常低的裁员率和工时下降表明，部分就业市场的强劲表现是由于雇主“囤积”劳动力。她解释说，那些在新冠封锁解除后难以招聘工人的人不想在需求回升时再次陷入同样的境地。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-24\">“然而，这比往常多了很多年初的薪水支票，”她补充道。“当结合对前两个月的上调和比预期更高的工资增长时，这表明劳动力市场可能正在重新加速。”</p><div class=\"n-content-big-number\"><span class=\"n-content-big-number__title is-text-only\" id=\"id-25\">3.3%</span><span class=\"n-content-big-number__content is-text-only\" id=\"id-26\">美国经济在第四季度的增长率</span></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-27\">农场信贷提供商AgAmerica Lending的高级总监Curt Covington表示，在像加利福尼亚这样的州，工资压力仍然很高。今年，加利福尼亚州的最低工资标准再次上涨了50美分，达到每小时16美元，而疫情爆发时的最低工资标准为每小时12美元。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-28\">“某些商品的生产非常依赖劳动力，尤其是特种作物，”科温顿说。“在中西部的作物，如玉米和大豆，劳动力成本的增加并不明显，但是当涉及到一些水果和蔬菜等特种作物时，劳动力成本显著上升。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-29\">一些经济学家担心，由于供应链压力的缓解导致商品价格的通缩将很快结束，使得抑制整体价格增长的工作更加困难。这一点尤其重要，考虑到美国需求强劲，第四季度经济以年化3.3%的速度增长。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-30\">普拉丹认为，固执地高薪增长是央行行长们在准备“通缩旅程的最后一英里”时面临的主要疑问。</p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/16674258?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-31\">但他仍然乐观。他认为，美国的工资增长应该是温和的，因为它得到了强劲的生产率增长的支持。在欧洲，疲弱的经济需求应该会导致“持续的调整”。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-32\">其他人指出，美联储面临的情况与20世纪70年代和80年代初期所见的可怕的工资-价格螺旋非常不同。美联储前经济学家克劳迪娅•萨姆(Claudia Sahm)兼Sahm Consulting创始人克劳迪娅•萨姆表示：“这次通胀并不主要是由需求引起的，而是由于新冠疫情导致的供应链、劳动力市场和支出的中断。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-33\">“生产力继续保持良好，”她补充道。“美国经济可以承受更高的工资。”</p><hr><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-34\"><strong>在欧洲央行</strong>，决策者明确表示，未来几个月他们的主要关注点将是工资协议是否与2%的通胀目标相符。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-35\">去年12月，德国央行行长约阿希姆•纳格尔(Joachim Nagel)警告说，通胀是一头“顽固而贪婪的野兽”，要将其降下来需要“咬紧牙关，坚持不懈”。最近，纳格尔在柏林的一次活动上表现得更加乐观，称这头野兽已经被“驯服”了。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-36\">但拉加德一直警告说，在目前阶段讨论可能的降息是“过早”的，这主要是因为工资上涨。欧洲央行和其他地方的担忧是，工人们将要求大幅加薪，以恢复他们在价格初始上涨期间失去的购买力。随着这种增加的消费能力进入经济，它会引发新一轮的价格上涨。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-37\">去年，欧元区的工资上涨了5%以上，接近年通胀率。拉加德表示，尽管最近的数据显示工资压力“已经在下降”，但欧洲央行仍希望确保更高的劳动力成本被公司“充分吸收”，而不是通过提高价格来降低利润率。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-38\">欧元区通胀率从2022年底的创纪录的10.6%稳步下降至3%以下，但拉加德对一个领域的价格似乎更为固定表示担忧，这个领域是劳动力占总成本的很大比例的服务业。欧元区服务业价格在截至1月份的一年内连续第三个月上涨了4%。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-39\">与美国一样，这些担忧是由该地区劳动力市场的意外韧性所支撑的。欧元区12月的失业率仍然保持在6.4%的历史低点，许多公司，特别是服务业，仍然抱怨劳动力短缺是生产的主要制约因素。</p><div class=\"n-content-big-number\"><span class=\"n-content-big-number__title is-text-only\" id=\"id-40\">6.4%</span><span class=\"n-content-big-number__content is-text-only\" id=\"id-41\">12月欧元区失业率创历史新低</span></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-42\">但是和美国一样，乐观的经济学家对欧洲即将陷入工资-物价螺旋的想法不屑一顾，指出除了比利时等少数国家外，工资与物价的自动“指数化”已经基本消失。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-43\">与之前高通胀时期的一个关键区别是，工资似乎是在跟随价格而不是引领价格，据高盛(Goldman Sachs)的首席欧洲经济学家斯文•贾里•斯特恩(Sven Jari Stehn)表示。他说：“当你有一个推高价格的供应冲击时，对工资的影响会有滞后效应，但风险并不是很大。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-44\">尽管劳动力市场紧张，但对许多公司来说，很难承担更高的工资成本，因为与美国不同，基本经济状况停滞不前。因此，尽管工会上周要求德国化工工人薪资上涨6%至7%，但这似乎不太可能引发该行业的价格飙升，该行业去年产量下降了11%。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-45\">“工资的一次性上涨与螺旋式上涨截然不同，”前欧洲央行官员、现任德国经济研究所所长弗拉茨舍尔(Marcel Fratzscher)表示。“欧洲央行应该对一次性调整进行视而不见。”</p><blockquote class=\"n-content-pullquote\"><div class=\"n-content-pullquote__content\"><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-46\">工资的一次性上涨与螺旋式上涨截然不同。欧洲央行应该忽略一次性调整</p><footer class=\"n-content-pullquote__footer\"></footer></div></blockquote><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-47\">私下里，欧洲央行的利率制定者表示他们感到自信。“我们看到指标朝着正确的方向发展，”该行的一位理事会成员表示。“货币政策正在发挥作用，通货膨胀正在下降。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-48\">英格兰银行的官员们似乎并不那么确信，至少目前还不是。上周，贝利的政策委员会将利率维持在5.25%后，他终于敞开了降低利率的大门，但英格兰银行行长似乎在谈到降息问题时小心翼翼，好像大声提及这个想法会引发市场的不必要的安慰。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-49\">英国央行警告称，尽管英国劳动力市场已经冷却，但仍然“相对于历史标准而言紧张”，并继续强调持续的价格压力指标，包括工资增长和服务业通胀。英国央行地区代理的一项调查显示，今年的工资协议将下降至平均5.4%，这个数字与去年的6%相差不远。</p><hr><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-50\"><strong>对通胀的其他</strong>“上行风险”引发了央行行动的谨慎。其中一个明显的风险源于中东地区持续的冲突；胡塞叛军对红海(Red Sea)船只发动的袭击导致航运中断，被广泛认为是可能推高通胀超出预期的因素。欧洲似乎特别容易受到影响，因为这条贸易路线对于从中国进口货物非常重要。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-51\">然而，包括欧洲央行的拉加德在内的利率制定者倾向于淡化这个问题，并指出航运仅占商品总成本的1.5％。经济学家似乎也持相同观点。高盛估计集装箱运输费用的上涨只会给全球通胀率增加0.1个百分点。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-52\">即使欧洲央行最新的人工智能驱动的通胀预测模型显示，通胀率将在今年夏天下降到接近2%，比仅几周前央行的预测要低得多。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-53\">然而，银行可能仍然谨慎行事，不会过早采取行动，以免在通胀再次飙升时被迫突然改变政策。国际货币基金组织本身在去年警告称，中央银行过早宣布对抗通胀取得胜利的历史非常丰富。</p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/16674166?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-54\">这包括美国本身，美联储主席阿瑟•伯恩斯(Arthur Burns)被指责在20世纪70年代初对通胀问题过于放松，未能解决困扰美国经济整整十年的祸患。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-55\">前美联储官员、现任投资银行Evercore-ISI副主席克里希纳•古哈(Krishna Guha)表示，供应驱动的通胀迅速逆转与国内价格坚挺上涨形成鲜明对比，使得央行面临着微妙的平衡挑战。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-56\">“你要确保不要因为过长时间保持过紧的政策而危及软着陆，”他说。“工作还没有完全完成，但他们已经相当接近——在某些情况下非常接近——成功实现了这一目标。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-57\">萨姆更加自信，称市场已经有了“几个月的良好价格数据。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-58\">“这个[1月份]的就业报告并不改变事实，即最困难的是第一英里，而不是最后一英里。”</p><p><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-59\">数据可视化</em><a
