So the high drama that unfolded between Xi Jinping, Beijing’s authoritarian leader, and Hu Jintao, his predecessor, in front of the world’s television cameras in 2022 rated as communist box office.</p><p>Xi and Hu were sitting next to each other before the massed ranks of deputies at the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist party, a convocation so important that it is held only once every five years. Xi had used the congress to secure a third term as head of the party, a distinction that effectively meant he was set up to become China’s “leader for life”.</p><p>But something was amiss. At the closing ceremony, Hu reached to take a red folder in front of him. Another Chinese official slid it out of his grasp. Xi then signalled to an orderly who grabbed Hu under an armpit and escorted him from the auditorium. </p><p>On the way out, Hu touched the shoulder of Li Keqiang, China’s premier, a former protégé, but the premier offered him only the merest of acknowledgments. As Hu was hustled out, none of a seated row of top officials even so much as turned to wish him well. They stared straight ahead, studiously ignoring his humiliation.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/74d8647a-c12e-4877-8f93-1929d0b6c2d9\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content><p>This chilling episode is one of many analysed in a probing new book by Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung, two respected sinologists at Soas University of London. Over seven chapters, it dissects what must have a claim to be the most important yet least understood political philosophy of our age. </p><p><em>The Political Thought of Xi Jinping</em> jettisons a vogue for China books with sensationalist titles (<em>Danger Zone</em>,<em> Destined for War</em>,<em> When China Rules the World </em>and so on) but offers a valuable service. Patient scholarship is deployed to slash through a jungle of jargon and impenetrable doublespeak until shafts of light shine through. </p><p>Understanding what is truly meant by Xi’s “community with a shared future for humankind”, “Chinese Dream”, “dual circulation” and several other slogans is part of the demystifying process. But the ultimate conclusion of Tsang and Cheung could not be more stark.</p><p>“In short, Xi’s vision puts the Party led by himself front and centre to forge a single powerful country with all its people united in the ambition of restoring China to its ‘historic’ place as the centre of the world,” they write. Thus, all of Xi’s circumlocutions end with a single ambition — “One Country, One People, One Ideology, One Party and One Leader”.</p><p>Anything or anybody who gets in the way — as Hu apparently did that day — is dealt with. The reason that Hu was prevented from opening the red folder, Tsang and Cheung say, is that the dossier inside would have revealed that his protégé, Hu Chunhua, had failed to secure promotion to the politburo. With this move, Xi was amputating his predecessor’s power base.</p><p>Another book that seeks to demystify the world’s second superpower is <em>China’s World View</em> by David Daokui Li, one of China’s most high-profile academics and founding dean of the Schwarzman College at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Li has also served as an influential adviser to China’s central bank.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/80d860c5-b8c4-4de9-a797-9106c2f96617\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content><p>Given his status as an insider, readers might expect a recitation of CCP talking points. But this thought-provoking book is far more nuanced, honest and at times critical of China’s reality. Written in the vein of a tutorial for interested foreign observers, Li’s book seeks to explain how China really works, with chapters on the central government, local governments, corruption, the environment and other aspects of the national polity.</p><p>Li’s view of Xi is much more favourable than that of Tsang and Cheung. At times, he lets slip fascinating vignettes: Xi’s first wife, Ke Lingling, sought to divorce him, wanting to emigrate to the UK. “For one year, every week he would make phone calls to the UK to persuade her to come back,” Li writes. Ke did not heed his entreaties and the couple divorced in 1982.</p><p>Li portrays Xi as a detail-orientated leader with a thirst for first-hand knowledge. In a meeting that Li attended, Xi is quoted as saying: “I want to taste the steam bun myself. I don’t want other people to chew it for me.” </p><p>One big challenge that Xi faces, according to Li, is that as people become better educated — with over 50 per cent of young people attending college — they are increasingly argumentative and expressive. “Obviously, no Chinese leaders confronted such an issue until now,” he writes.</p><p>In the chapter on local governments, he is similarly frank. He tells the story of a highly capable local official named Chen, who knew that “superb job performance would not be enough to secure a promotion”. Chen chose to bribe a powerful political mentor who himself was later sentenced to life in prison for taking “huge bribes”. Chen went down in the fallout, confessing to bribery and ending up in jail. </p><p>The reader is left with a sense of how difficult China’s governance model makes it for local officials to remain uncorrupted. But Li remains optimistic, seeing a future reminiscent of Singapore, in which officials are paid so handsomely that the incentive to be corrupt is diminished.</p><p>The final chapter in his book argues that the rise of China is unlikely to cause a war — either hot or cold — with the US. Li’s argument rests on an assertion that China’s emergence will provide economic opportunities for most people in the world, more public goods in the form of advances in science and technology, and a more effective fight against climate change. </p><p>This may be true but only up to a point. The much less appealing reality for many in the west is that as Chinese industries climb the value chain, they are eating away at the market share of the west’s most vaunted corporations. </p><p>Politicians in Washington, Brussels, Berlin and elsewhere are growing increasingly concerned that China’s rise will not enhance the west but hollow it out. And that, to borrow Tsang and Cheung’s vision, will embolden China’s ambition of seizing a place at the centre of world affairs.</p><p><strong>The Political Thought of Xi Jinping </strong>by Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung <em>OUP £22.99/$29.95, 272 pages</em></p><p><strong>China’s World View: Demystifying China to Prevent Global Conflict</strong> by David Daokui Li <em>WW Norton £22.99, 288 pages</em></p><p><em>James Kynge is the FT’s global China editor</em></p><p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a><em> and subscribe to our podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/lifeandartpodcast\"><em>Life &amp; Art</em></a><em> wherever you listen</em></p></body>",

        "bodyXML": "<p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-0\">It is rare that disagreements among China’s political elite are reflected or even hinted at in public. So the high drama that unfolded between Xi Jinping, Beijing’s authoritarian leader, and Hu Jintao, his predecessor, in front of the world’s television cameras in 2022 rated as communist box office.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-1\">Xi and Hu were sitting next to each other before the massed ranks of deputies at the 20th Congress of the Chinese Communist party, a convocation so important that it is held only once every five years. Xi had used the congress to secure a third term as head of the party, a distinction that effectively meant he was set up to become China’s “leader for life”.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-2\">But something was amiss. At the closing ceremony, Hu reached to take a red folder in front of him. Another Chinese official slid it out of his grasp. Xi then signalled to an orderly who grabbed Hu under an armpit and escorted him from the auditorium.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-3\">On the way out, Hu touched the shoulder of Li Keqiang, China’s premier, a former protégé, but the premier offered him only the merest of acknowledgments. As Hu was hustled out, none of a seated row of top officials even so much as turned to wish him well. They stared straight ahead, studiously ignoring his humiliation.</p><div class=\"pic leftPic\"><picture><img src=\"https://d1sh1cgb4xvhl.cloudfront.net/unsafe/400x0/https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/6e579b99-3df0-431a-98c6-62f65c10fcb5.jpg\"></picture></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-4\">This chilling episode is one of many analysed in a probing new book by Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung, two respected sinologists at Soas University of London. Over seven chapters, it dissects what must have a claim to be the most important yet least understood political philosophy of our age.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-5\"><em>The Political Thought of Xi Jinping</em> jettisons a vogue for China books with sensationalist titles (<em>Danger Zone</em>,<em> Destined for War</em>,<em> When China Rules the World </em>and so on) but offers a valuable service. Patient scholarship is deployed to slash through a jungle of jargon and impenetrable doublespeak until shafts of light shine through.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-6\">Understanding what is truly meant by Xi’s “community with a shared future for humankind”, “Chinese Dream”, “dual circulation” and several other slogans is part of the demystifying process. But the ultimate conclusion of Tsang and Cheung could not be more stark.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-7\">“In short, Xi’s vision puts the Party led by himself front and centre to forge a single powerful country with all its people united in the ambition of restoring China to its ‘historic’ place as the centre of the world,” they write. Thus, all of Xi’s circumlocutions end with a single ambition — “One Country, One People, One Ideology, One Party and One Leader”.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-8\">Anything or anybody who gets in the way — as Hu apparently did that day — is dealt with. The reason that Hu was prevented from opening the red folder, Tsang and Cheung say, is that the dossier inside would have revealed that his protégé, Hu Chunhua, had failed to secure promotion to the politburo. With this move, Xi was amputating his predecessor’s power base.</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-9\">Another book that seeks to demystify the world’s second superpower is <em>China’s World View</em> by David Daokui Li, one of China’s most high-profile academics and founding dean of the Schwarzman College at Tsinghua University in Beijing. Li has also served as an influential adviser to China’s central bank.</p><div class=\"pic leftPic\"><picture><img src=\"https://d1sh1cgb4xvhl.cloudfront.net/unsafe/400x0/https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/56b88fb1-a74a-47ad-a9ee-ee673f3e0bb6.jpg\"></picture></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-10\">Given his status as an insider, readers might expect a recitation of CCP talking points. But this thought-provoking book is far more nuanced, honest and at times critical of China’s reality. Written in the vein of a tutorial for interested foreign observers, Li’s book seeks to explain how China really works, with chapters on the central government, local governments, corruption, the environment and other aspects of the national polity.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-11\">Li’s view of Xi is much more favourable than that of Tsang and Cheung. At times, he lets slip fascinating vignettes: Xi’s first wife, Ke Lingling, sought to divorce him, wanting to emigrate to the UK. “For one year, every week he would make phone calls to the UK to persuade her to come back,” Li writes. Ke did not heed his entreaties and the couple divorced in 1982.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-12\">Li portrays Xi as a detail-orientated leader with a thirst for first-hand knowledge. In a meeting that Li attended, Xi is quoted as saying: “I want to taste the steam bun myself. I don’t want other people to chew it for me.”&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-13\">One big challenge that Xi faces, according to Li, is that as people become better educated — with over 50 per cent of young people attending college — they are increasingly argumentative and expressive. “Obviously, no Chinese leaders confronted such an issue until now,” he writes.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-14\">In the chapter on local governments, he is similarly frank. He tells the story of a highly capable local official named Chen, who knew that “superb job performance would not be enough to secure a promotion”. Chen chose to bribe a powerful political mentor who himself was later sentenced to life in prison for taking “huge bribes”. Chen went down in the fallout, confessing to bribery and ending up in jail.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-15\">The reader is left with a sense of how difficult China’s governance model makes it for local officials to remain uncorrupted. But Li remains optimistic, seeing a future reminiscent of Singapore, in which officials are paid so handsomely that the incentive to be corrupt is diminished.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-16\">The final chapter in his book argues that the rise of China is unlikely to cause a war — either hot or cold — with the US. Li’s argument rests on an assertion that China’s emergence will provide economic opportunities for most people in the world, more public goods in the form of advances in science and technology, and a more effective fight against climate change.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-17\">This may be true but only up to a point. The much less appealing reality for many in the west is that as Chinese industries climb the value chain, they are eating away at the market share of the west’s most vaunted corporations. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-18\">Politicians in Washington, Brussels, Berlin and elsewhere are growing increasingly concerned that China’s rise will not enhance the west but hollow it out. And that, to borrow Tsang and Cheung’s vision, will embolden China’s ambition of seizing a place at the centre of world affairs.</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-19\"><strong>The Political Thought of Xi Jinping </strong>by Steve Tsang and Olivia Cheung <em>OUP £22.99/$29.95, 272 pages</em></p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-20\"><strong>China’s World View: Demystifying China to Prevent Global Conflict</strong> by David Daokui Li <em>WW Norton £22.99, 288 pages</em></p><p><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-21\">James Kynge is the FT’s global China editor</em></p><p><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-22\">Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-23\">FT Books Café</em></a><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-24\"> and subscribe to our podcast </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/lifeandartpodcast\"><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-25\">Life &amp; Art</em></a><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-26\"> wherever you listen</em></p>",
        "bodyXMLTranslation": "<p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-0\">中国政治精英之间的分歧很少在公众场合中得到反映或暗示。因此，2022年在全球电视摄像机面前发生的习近平（北京的威权领导人）与他的前任胡锦涛(Hu Jintao)之间的高潮戏剧成为了共产主义的票房吸引力。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-1\">习近平和胡锦涛坐在中国共产党第20次全国代表大会的代表们面前，这是一次如此重要的大会，每五年才举行一次。习近平利用这次大会成功获得了党的第三个任期，这个荣誉实际上意味着他将成为中国的“终身领导人”。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-2\">但是有些不对劲。在闭幕式上，胡锦涛伸手拿起他面前的一个红色文件夹。另一位中国官员将其从他手中滑走。习近平随后示意一名侍从，后者从胳膊下抓住胡锦涛，并将他从礼堂护送出去。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-3\">在离开的时候，胡锦涛轻轻拍了一下中国总理李克强(Li Keqiang)的肩膀，李克强只是稍微点了点头示意。当胡锦涛被推出去的时候，坐在一排的高级官员中没有一个人甚至转过头来祝他好运。他们一直盯着前方，刻意忽视他的羞辱。</p><div class=\"pic leftPic\"><picture><img src=\"https://d1sh1cgb4xvhl.cloudfront.net/unsafe/400x0/https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/6e579b99-3df0-431a-98c6-62f65c10fcb5.jpg\"></picture></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-4\">这个令人不寒而栗的事件是史蒂夫•曾锐生(Steve Tsang)和奥利维亚•张教授在伦敦大学亚非学院撰写的一本深入研究的新书中分析的众多案例之一。在七个章节中，它剖析了这个可能是我们这个时代最重要但最不为人所理解的政治哲学。</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-5\"><em>《习近平政治思想》</em>摒弃了一些以耸人听闻的标题命名的中国书籍（《危险区域》、《注定战争》、《当中国统治全球》等），但提供了宝贵的服务。通过耐心的学术研究，它剖析了一片术语和晦涩难懂的言辞的丛林，直到光芒照耀出来。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-6\">理解习近平所说的“人类命运共同体”、“中国梦”(Chinese Dream)、“双循环”以及其他一些口号的真正含义是揭开神秘面纱的一部分。但曾锐生和曾锐生的最终结论却更加鲜明。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-7\">他们写道：“简而言之，习近平的愿景将以他自己为核心的中国共产党置于首位，与全体人民一道，致力于将中国恢复到其作为世界中心的‘历史’地位。” 因此，习近平的所有迂回都以一个雄心结束——“一个国家，一个民族，一个意识形态，一个党和一个领导者”。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-8\">任何阻碍的事物或人——就像胡锦涛那天所做的那样——都会被处理。曾锐生和张表示，胡锦涛被阻止打开红色文件夹的原因是里面的档案将揭示他的门徒胡春华未能晋升中央政治局。通过这一举动，习近平削弱了他前任的权力基础。</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-9\">另一本旨在揭开全球第二超级大国面纱的书籍是《中国的全球观》，作者是中国最知名的学者之一、北京清华大学(Tsinghua University)苏世民书院(Schwarzman College)创院院长李稻葵(David Daokui Li)。李稻葵还曾担任中国央行的重要顾问。</p><div class=\"pic leftPic\"><picture><img src=\"https://d1sh1cgb4xvhl.cloudfront.net/unsafe/400x0/https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/56b88fb1-a74a-47ad-a9ee-ee673f3e0bb6.jpg\"></picture></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-10\">鉴于他作为内部人的身份，读者可能期望他陈述中国共产党(CCP)的观点。但是这本发人深省的书更加细致入微、真实，并且有时对中国的现实持批评态度。李稻葵的书以向外界感兴趣的观察者提供教程的方式编写，旨在解释中国的真实运作方式，包括中央政府、地方政府、腐败、环境和国家政治的其他方面。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-11\">李稻葵对习近平的看法比曾锐生和张更为赞许。有时，他不经意间透露出一些有趣的小插曲：习近平的第一任妻子柯玲玲(Ke Lingling)曾试图与他离婚，希望移民到英国。“一年里，他每周都会给英国打电话劝她回来，”李稻葵写道。柯玲玲没有听从他的劝告，于1982年离婚。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-12\">李稻葵将习近平描绘成一个注重细节、渴望亲身了解的领导者。在李参加的一次会议上，习近平被引用说：“我想亲自尝一下这个包子。我不想让别人替我嚼。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-13\">根据李稻葵的说法，习面临的一个重大挑战是随着人们受教育程度的提高——超过50%的年轻人上大学——他们变得越来越善于争论和表达。他写道：“显然，中国领导人直到现在都没有面对过这样的问题。”</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-14\">在关于地方政府的章节中，他同样坦率。他讲述了一个名叫陈的非常有能力的地方官员的故事，他知道“出色的工作表现不足以确保晋升”。陈选择贿赂一个权势强大的政治导师，后者因为收受“巨额贿赂”而被判终身监禁。陈在这场风波中倒下，承认了行贿并最终坐牢。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-15\">读者对中国的治理模式有了一种难以保持廉洁的地方官员的困难的感觉。但是李稻葵仍然保持乐观，他看到了一个类似新加坡的未来，其中官员的薪水如此丰厚，以至于腐败的动机减少了。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-16\">他的书中的最后一章论述了中国的崛起不太可能引发与美国的战争，无论是热战还是冷战。李稻葵的论点建立在一个断言上，即中国的崛起将为世界上大多数人提供经济机会，以科技进步的形式提供更多的公共产品，并更有效地应对气候变化。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-17\">这可能是真的，但只有到一定程度。对于许多西方人来说，更不吸引人的现实是，随着中国产业攀升价值链，它们正在侵蚀西方最受推崇的公司的市场份额。</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-18\">华盛顿、布鲁塞尔、柏林和其他地方的政治家们越来越担心中国的崛起不会增强西方，而是使其空心化。借用曾锐生和张的观点，这将使中国夺取世界事务中心的野心更加坚定。</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-19\"><strong>《习近平的政治思想》</strong> 史蒂夫•曾锐生、张奥利维亚著，牛津大学出版社，22.99英镑/29.95美元，272页</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-20\">《中国的全球观：揭秘中国以防止全球冲突》李稻葵著，WW Norton出版社，22.99英镑，288页</p><p><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-21\">金奇(James Kynge)是FT的中国编辑。</em></p><p><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-22\">在Facebook上加入我们的在线书籍小组</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-23\">FT 读书咖啡馆(FT Books Café)</em></a><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-24\">并订阅我们的播客</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/lifeandartpodcast\"><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-25\">生活与艺术</em></a><em class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-26\">无论你在哪里听</em></p>",
