But the latest foray appears to form part of a counteroffensive strategy to pin down Russian forces and create multiple bridgeheads for a future broader attack, analysts say.</p><p>It came as Kyiv’s allies grow increasingly restless about the limited progress in Ukrainian forces’ attempts to penetrate the enemy’s fortified defences and make sizeable gains in occupied territories.</p><p>“The Ukrainian armed forces will be hoping that the Kherson raid puts the Russians in a dilemma about whether Ukraine is going to do something more significant in Kherson or . . . draw off Russian reserves,” said Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army major-general and military strategist. </p><p>He said both sides were “trying to find weaknesses in their adversary,” keep their opponents guessing and lure them into diverting resources away from where a major strike could take place.</p><p>Ukrainian forces began their renewed offensive in June south of Zaporizhzhia city but have been carrying out raids across the Dnipro since the autumn. By June 6, the night before the Nova Kakhovka dam <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10ba2659-3204-4fde-b407-6904a408c931\">burst</a> and flooded the surrounding area, Ukrainian forces were stationed on islands in the river and Russian military bloggers expressed fears they were preparing a big assault — but Russian drone footage from the day the dam burst shows Ukrainians fleeing on boats back to Ukrainian-controlled Kherson.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Content\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/14692156\" alt=\"Ukrainian troops have been carrying out raids on Russian positions across the Dnipro river\" data-asset-type=\"flourish\" data-embedded=\"true\" data-flourish-type=\"visualisation\" data-layout-width=\"\" data-time-stamp=\"\" id=\"14692156\"></ft-content><p>A few weeks later, Ukrainians crossed the river near the Antonivsky bridge north of Kherson city, where they dug in for at least a week. Analysts at US-based think-tank the Institute for the Study of War raised the possibility that some Ukrainians may have maintained a small foothold on the eastern bank, but the governor of Russian-occupied Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said Ukraine’s forces were “eliminated” there on July 1.</p><p>Michael Clarke, a military expert and former head of the Royal United Services Institute, said the raids were apparently seeking to establish small pockets of Ukrainian forces that could then be used for a broader attack to clear Russian forces from the southern east bank.</p><p>“We don’t know exactly what the axis of their attack is going to be, but all of the signs are — and there could be some grand deception in this — they want to go south of Orikhiv towards Tokmak and Melitopol,” he said, referring to Ukraine’s current offensive push in southern Zaporizhzhia, north-east of where the raids are taking place.  </p><p>Drawing more Russian troops into defending Kherson could shore up Ukraine’s positions elsewhere, particularly further east where Kyiv hopes to sever a land bridge to Crimea that Russian forces hold. Moscow occupied the peninsula in 2014 and has stationed its Black Sea fleet there, which is regularly being used to launch missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p><p>This week several Russian military bloggers said there had been skirmishes in areas where the Dnipro constitutes the front line, with one asserting that Ukrainian forces managed to advance 800 metres through Russian defences near the town of Kozachi Laheri.</p><p>“One objective was set [this week] and it was executed but we can’t here and now say what exactly it was,” said Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister.</p><p>The Institute for the Study of War confirmed the skirmishes based on Nasa data that uses infrared sensors to detect wildfires, and that can also be used to determine battle hotspots in Ukraine.</p><p>In a report published on Tuesday, the think-tank said Ukrainian forces appeared to have conducted a “limited raid” across the Dnipro river but that it “remains unclear whether Ukrainian troops have established an enduring presence on the east bank”.</p><p>Elsewhere, over the more than 1,000km of frontline positions where intense battles including artillery duels are playing out, Ukraine is continuing to launch attacks despite the strength of Russian defences, which include heavily mined territory and extensive networks of trenches.</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/18f1bfb7-9bdf-4e6f-b54c-fbc7bc65ae8e\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content><p>Maliar said on Wednesday that Ukraine had made additional moderate gains in the south and east of the country, where troops were trying to liberate about 18 per cent of territory still occupied by Russia.</p><p>“Our defenders had partial success in the direction of Urozhayne, Priyutne and Verbove,” she said referring to villages on the southern front line north of the Sea of Azov.</p><p>Ukraine’s army, she said, continued to “conduct offensive actions on the southern flank” of the eastern bombed-out city of Bakhmut, where it is trying to semi-encircle Russian troops that captured it after a bloody nine-month assault.</p><p>“The main direction of the enemy offensive remains the Kupyansk direction,” she said, referring to the city in north-eastern parts of Ukraine liberated last autumn in an unexpected counteroffensive.</p><p>“Here the enemy has formed an offensive group and is trying to move forward, but without success,” Maliar added.</p><p>Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence said that Russia was still trying to achieve its reduced aims of reaching the Donetsk administrative borders a year and half into the war.<br/><br/>“The operations Russia are conducting are not strategic military theatre, only localised attacks,” said Vadym Skibitsky.  </p><p>Clarke characterised Russia’s attack in Kupyansk as “a northern counterpunch” and said it was the only “strategic innovation” in Russia’s otherwise static defence plans along the fortified front line.</p><p>“There’s a kind of a symmetry here between what the Ukrainians are doing in Kherson — trying to give the Russians something else to worry about further west — and what the Russians are trying to do in Kupyansk — trying to give the Ukrainians something to worry about in the north.”</p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Video\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/742ac4f8-44d7-4ab8-a4e9-5814aae9b566\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content></body>",

But the latest foray appears to form part of a counteroffensive strategy to pin down Russian forces and create multiple bridgeheads for a future broader attack, analysts say.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-2\">It came as Kyiv’s allies grow increasingly restless about the limited progress in Ukrainian forces’ attempts to penetrate the enemy’s fortified defences and make sizeable gains in occupied territories.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-3\">“The Ukrainian armed forces will be hoping that the Kherson raid puts the Russians in a dilemma about whether Ukraine is going to do something more significant in Kherson or . . . draw off Russian reserves,” said Mick Ryan, a retired Australian Army major-general and military strategist. </p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-4\">He said both sides were “trying to find weaknesses in their adversary,” keep their opponents guessing and lure them into diverting resources away from where a major strike could take place.</p><p class=\"is-mixed\" id=\"id-5\">Ukrainian forces began their renewed offensive in June south of Zaporizhzhia city but have been carrying out raids across the Dnipro since the autumn.&nbsp;By June 6, the night before the Nova Kakhovka dam <a href=\"/interactive/111357?subtype=bilingual\">burst</a> and flooded the surrounding area, Ukrainian forces were stationed on islands in the river and Russian military bloggers expressed fears they were preparing a big assault — but Russian drone footage from the day the dam burst shows Ukrainians fleeing on boats back to Ukrainian-controlled Kherson.</p><div class=\"flourish-embed\" data-src=\"visualisation/14692156?hideSignature\"></div><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-6\">A few weeks later, Ukrainians crossed the river near the Antonivsky bridge north of Kherson city, where they dug in for at least a week. Analysts at US-based think-tank the Institute for the Study of War raised the possibility that some Ukrainians may have maintained a small foothold on the eastern bank, but the governor of Russian-occupied Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, said Ukraine’s forces were “eliminated” there on July 1.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-7\">Michael Clarke, a military expert and former head of the Royal United Services Institute, said the raids were apparently seeking to establish&nbsp;small pockets of Ukrainian forces that could then be used for a broader attack to clear Russian forces from the southern east bank.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-8\">“We don’t know exactly what the axis of their attack is going to be, but all of the signs are — and there could be some grand deception in this — they want to go south of Orikhiv towards Tokmak and Melitopol,” he said, referring to Ukraine’s current offensive push in southern Zaporizhzhia, north-east of where the raids are taking place. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-9\">Drawing more Russian troops into defending Kherson could shore up Ukraine’s positions elsewhere, particularly further east where Kyiv hopes to sever a land bridge to Crimea that Russian forces hold. Moscow occupied the peninsula in 2014 and has stationed its Black Sea fleet there, which is regularly being used to launch missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-10\">This week several Russian military bloggers said there had been skirmishes in areas where the Dnipro constitutes the front line, with one asserting that Ukrainian forces managed to advance 800 metres through Russian defences near the town of Kozachi Laheri.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-11\">“One objective was set [this week] and it was executed but we can’t here and now say what exactly it was,” said Hanna Maliar, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-12\">The Institute for the Study of War confirmed the skirmishes based on Nasa data that uses infrared sensors to detect wildfires, and that can also be used to determine battle hotspots in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-13\">In a report published on Tuesday, the think-tank said Ukrainian forces appeared to have conducted a “limited raid” across the Dnipro river but that it “remains unclear whether Ukrainian troops have established an enduring presence on the east bank”.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-14\">Elsewhere, over the more than 1,000km of frontline positions where intense battles including artillery duels are playing out, Ukraine is continuing to launch attacks despite the strength of Russian defences, which include heavily mined territory and extensive networks of trenches.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-15\">Maliar said on Wednesday that Ukraine had made additional moderate gains in the south and east of the country, where troops were trying to liberate about 18 per cent of territory still occupied by Russia.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-16\">“Our defenders had partial success in the direction of Urozhayne, Priyutne and Verbove,” she said referring to villages on the southern front line north of the Sea of Azov.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-17\">Ukraine’s army, she said, continued to “conduct offensive actions on the southern flank” of the eastern bombed-out city of Bakhmut, where it is trying to semi-encircle Russian troops that captured it after a bloody nine-month assault.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-18\">“The main direction of the enemy offensive remains the Kupyansk direction,” she said, referring to the city in north-eastern parts of Ukraine liberated last autumn in an unexpected counteroffensive.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-19\">“Here the enemy has formed an offensive group and is trying to move forward, but without success,” Maliar added.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-20\">Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence said that Russia was still trying to achieve its reduced aims of reaching the Donetsk administrative borders a year and half into the war.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-21\">“The operations Russia are conducting are not strategic military theatre, only localised attacks,” said Vadym Skibitsky. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-22\">Clarke characterised Russia’s attack in Kupyansk as “a northern counterpunch” and said it was the only “strategic innovation” in Russia’s otherwise static defence plans along the fortified front line.</p><p class=\"is-text-only\" id=\"id-23\">“There’s a kind of a symmetry here between what the Ukrainians are doing in Kherson — trying to give the Russians something else to worry about further west — and what the Russians are trying to do in Kupyansk — trying to give the Ukrainians something to worry about in the north.”</p>",
