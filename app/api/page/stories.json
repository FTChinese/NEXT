elitism row<\/b>\uff08520words\uff09\nBy  Gonzalo Vi\u00f1a, Public Policy Reporter\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe university-wide tests will be standardised by subject, doing away with the myriad assessments at its colleges, and are being brought back to give admissions tutors a better idea of who to invite for interview now that schools are phasing out AS-levels.\n\nThe change comes as the Sutton Trust \u2014 a group that campaigns for greater social mobility \u2014 is this week expected to criticise Cambridge and Oxford universities for having labyrinthine admissions systems that deter applications from the brightest pupils at state schools.\n\nBritain\u2019s elite universities are coming under fire for failing to do enough to to tackle discrimination. This week, David Cameron accused them of not doing enough to attract students from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and announced plans to force them to publish the ethnic background of students.\n\nThe Sutton Trust will say that teachers from state schools that traditionally send few students to Oxbridge are deterred from putting bright students forward because of the complexity of the system to outsiders.\n\nThere are 11 different exams at Oxford while Cambridge, until now, appeared at first glance to have as many as 380 although, in practice, many of them are simple tests rather than exams.\n\nThe opaque admissions system is traditionally believed to be subject to the capricious whims of university dons and was infamously captured in an incident in the late 1990s when Essex schoolgirl Tracy Playle was brought to tears, claiming that Eric Griffiths, her interviewer, had mocked her accent and background.\n\n\nUnder the new system, Cambridge\u2019s 29 undergraduate colleges will bring in a common written assessment to provide \u201cvaluable additional evidence\u201d of academic ability, subject knowledge and \u201cpotential to succeed\u201d following demands from teachers and students. The new system will be in place for those applying for entry in 2017.\n\nThe Sutton Trust will say in a report this week that the proportion of state school students at both universities has increased in recent years. Cambridge accepted 62 per cent of its students from state schools in 2014, while Oxford took 56 per cent, up from a combined average of 47 per cent in 1997. But there were just a total of 40 Oxbridge students in 2012 who were once eligible for free school meals, a widely used measure of poverty.\n\nSir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \u201cWe welcome anymeasure to simplify the admissions procedures at Oxbridge. However, Cambridge should be aware that tests could present a disadvantage for low and middle income students as there is a thriving market in private tuition for the extra admissions tests used at Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n\u201cWe will of course ensure that any changes that are made are fully reflected in our summer school programme, which now has 600 places at Cambridge.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron this week said it was unacceptable that young black men were more likely to be in prison than studying at a top university, that there were no black generals in the armed forces, and that only 4 per cent of FTSE chief executives were from ethnic minorities.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a","industry":"","area":"\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"007000061","pubdate":"1454688000","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/1\/000058571_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6150","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454663331","cheadline":"\u8116\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u62cd\u7167\u76f8\u673a","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"pioneer|\u5148\u950b[pa\u026a\u0259\u2019n\u026a\u0259(r)]\ngadget|\u5c0f\u73a9\u610f[\u2019g\u00e6d\u0292\u026at]\npacemaker|\u9886\u8dd1\u8005['pe\u026asme\u026ak\u0259z]\ndoomed|\u96be\u9003\u4e00\u6b7b\u7684[d\u028amd]\nmeltdown|\u5f7b\u5e95\u57ae\u53f0[\u2019meltda\u028an]\nnarcissism|\u81ea\u604b[\u2019n\u0251:s\u026as\u026az\u0259m]\nnostalgic|\u6000\u65e7\u7684[n\u0252'st\u00e6ld\u0292\u026ak]\ngiggle|\u54af\u54af\u7684\u7b11['g\u026agl]\ngimmick|\u5671\u5934['g\u026am\u026ak]","cshortleadbody":"\u53f7\u79f0\u662f\u201c\u4e16\u754c\u9996\u6b3e\u667a\u80fd\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u76f8\u673a\u201d\u7684Autographer\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u53ef\u6302\u5728\u8116\u5b50\u4e0a\u6216\u8005\u522b\u5728\u8863\u670d\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u62cd\u7167\u76f8\u673a\u3002\u5b83\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c GPS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u5149\u5f71\u3001\u8272\u5f69\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u62cd\u7167\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u597d\u574f\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u786e\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u7279\u522b\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u624b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhere did Autographer launched in the first place?

It was welcomed as a wearable-technology pioneer and was British \u2014 unusually for a novel consumer gadget.\n\nAutographer was worn like a necklace and took thousands of photos a day, prompted by sensors that intelligently detected movement and other stimuli in the hope of getting the occasional nice snap. Its slick launch at London Zoo was greeted with some excitement. Wearable technology, at least for those who don\u2019t count glasses and pacemakers as trendy enough to be called that, was with us.\n\nI\u2019m glad\/relieved that I reported Autographer as fun but doomed, because the \u00a3400 device was abandoned a few weeks ago by the maker. It was not a start-up, but the successful and perfectly grown-up Oxford Metrics Group, for whom it seems to have been a fairly small-scale experiment with a consumer product.\n\nApart from the fact that Autographer did not pass the common sense test, there were early signs of its ultimate demise. I saw the team at a wearable-tech show five months after launch and asked how it was going. Wonderfully, I was told, and proving particularly popular with magicians. Interesting market, but perhaps a little niche.\n\nThinking about Autographer\u2019s fate, I\u2019m not inclined to go into middle-aged meltdown about narcissism and modern youth\u2019s obsession with recording everything rather than living in the moment. It\u2019s wiser to take all that lightly; it\u2019s not the end of civilisation. But you still would have thought that was it for tiny wearable cameras.\n\nYet now a Swedish company, Narrative, which launched a smaller version called Clip at about the same time, is having another run at the idea. Clip simply took a photo every 30 seconds, but Clip 2 also captures video on demand, like a GoPro but a fraction of the size.\n\nAnd looking at Narrative\u2019s website, a tiny bit of me is thinking it looks, well, almost desirable. I take a lot of mobile phone videos, not for sharing, but to watch in idle moments for nostalgic purposes. So perhaps carrying a body camera, like some police officers now do, would be interesting? It would at least be handy for resolving domestic disputes: \u201cYou say you told me to get cat food at the supermarket. Let\u2019s check the recording.\u201d\n\nThe first Clip got more traction than our brave, British chaps managed. It was adopted by the very god of life-logging, Morris Villarroel, professor of animal behaviour at Madrid\u2019s Polytechnic University. Prof Villarroel has kept a microscopically detailed diary of his daily life since 2010, but has reportedly been using a Narrative camera to add 700,000-plus photos to his voluminous handwritten notes.\n\nWill Narrative bring wearable cameras to the mainstream? Probably not, but its tiny dimensions and less-clunky design than Autographer mean that convincing mainstream consumers is not as inconceivable.\n\nThe point is that there is a decent record of outlier innovations that seem bonkers when mooted, before then taking off \u2014 usually after another company has a stab at them. Leaving aside inventions such as writing (which Socrates thought disruptive and undesirable) and the telephone (which almost everyone thought was a gimmick), technologies such as texting and phone cameras have surprised even their inventors by how popular they have proved.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop giggling at the launch of the first camera phone I saw in 2001; whatever next? Colleagues reported the development more as quirky Japanese stuff, but essentially unwanted. I envisaged an epidemic of people taking and sending unrequested photos of their genitalia, which kind of happened but has been far from the defining characteristic of the behemoth that is phone photography.\n\nWhat, then, of the innovation greeted with the least enthusiasm in recent memory \u2014 the Google Glass internet spectacles, which within days spawned the expression \u201cGlassholes\u201d to describe their users? Privacy issues, creepiness issues and looking-stupid issues were among the problems.\n\nAccording to industry chat, it\u2019s just possible that Glass will be back in a less ridiculous form. Google supposedly has a team reviving the project under the name Aura.

He has since headed its search engineering efforts as the company has consolidated its grip on internet search for most of the world and wrestled with the new approaches to search forced by things such as the rise of smartphone apps.\n\nFor Google, Mr Singhal\u2019s departure is as significant as the departure of design chief Sir Jony Ive would be for Apple, said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land and a long-time analyst of the search industry.\n\nHe called Mr Singhal the \u201cguiding force\u201d behind the Google search engine, which is still the main source of the company\u2019s profits, and an \u201corchestra leader\u201d who had succeeded in maintaining the quality of the search results as Google has grappled with the mass of new online information and new ways of searching.\n\nHis departure coincides with a wave of investment in artificial intelligence at Google, both to boost the overall quality of its core products as well as support a push into newer fields such as driverless cars and robotics.\n\nThe projects Mr Giannandrea has been in charge of at Google include RankBrain, a neural network \u2014 modelled on how layers of neurons in the brain interact \u2014 that tries to use machine intelligence to improve the ranking of search results without the intervention of human programmers.\n\nDespite the growing importance of AI, machines are not likely to seize control of Google\u2019s search algorithms for the foreseeable future, said Mr Sullivan. The technology has been put to use by Google to better understand what searchers are looking for, he said, but it is still a stretch for it to predict which piece of information people will find most useful.\n\nNevertheless, the rise of an AI expert to head the rankings group points to an underlying shift in the technology that could one day see much of the job of search ranking left to machines, said Greg Sterling, an analyst at the Local Search Association in the US.\n\nThe technology shift might one day leave Google\u2019s search engineers facing the risk of being put out of work by intelligent machines as workers in other fields, Mr Sterling said, though he added that there was always likely to be some level of human oversight.\n\n\u201cThere will always be some sort of human oversight or spot-checking,\u201d Mr Sterling said. \u201cThere will always be someone in the control room.\u201d\n\nMr Singhal has long used the fictional intelligent computer on Star Trek as the model for the perfect search engine. In a post on Google+ announcing he was leaving the company, he said he had first dreamt of the idea when growing up in the Himalayas. \u201cMy dream Star Trek computer is becoming a reality, and it is far better than what I ever imagined,\u201d he added.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406","industry":"\u4e92\u8054\u7f51","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1454515200","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/8\/000058528_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6133","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454491433","cheadline":"\u518d\u6b21\u56de\u5f52\uff1a\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u91cd\u8fd4VR","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"foray|\u88ad\u51fb['f\u0252re\u026a]\nfiscal|\u8d22\u653f\u7684['f\u026ask(\u0259)l]\nlacklustre|\u65e0\u5149\u6cfd\u7684['l\u00e6k,l\u028cst\u0259]\nblockbuster|\u4e00\u9e23\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u4eba['bl\u0252kb\u028cst\u0259]\nmonochrome|\u9ed1\u767d\u7684\uff0c\u5355\u8272\u7684['m\u0251n\u0259krom]\ncompelling|\u5f15\u4eba\u6ce8\u76ee\u7684[k\u0259m'pel\u026a\u014b]","cshortleadbody":"\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u57281995\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u754c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b3e\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u6e38\u620f\u673a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5f53\u65f6\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u5927\u80c6\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u201cVirtual Boy\u201d\u5374\u672a\u80fd\u88ab\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u53d7\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhere is Nintendo\u2019s headquarters?<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=rightanswer>\n\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u7684\u603b\u90e8\u5728\u4eac\u90fd\u3002 <\/div>\n<ul class=quizlist>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Tokyo  <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Hokkaido  <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=1> Kyoto <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Sapporo <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWho is Nintendo\u2019s rival, producing PlayStation 4?

Sales of its game devices also fell amid the absence of blockbuster titles while rival Sony continues to enjoy strong sales with its PlayStation 4 console.\n\nFor the quarter from October to December, net profit fell to Y29.1bn ($241m) from Y45.2bn a year earlier. That came in slightly above the Y23bn forecast by analysts.\n\nMr Kimishima told a news conference the company was carrying out research into virtual reality. It was an \u201cinteresting technology\u201d, he said, but there was no specific plan to launch a product soon.\n\nNintendo was one of the first games groups to try to bring VR to consumers when it launched the Virtual Boy in 1995. But the firm abandoned the clunky red headset a year later amid complaints its monochrome screen caused headache.\n\nSince then, technological advances have prompted a string of companies to enter the field. Facebook-owned Oculus VR began taking pre-orders for its Rift headset last month, while Sony\u2019s PlayStation VR will be launched in the first half of 2016. Apple also hired one of the top US researchers in virtual reality.\n\nNaoki Fujiwara of Shinkin Asset Management said: \u201cIt has now become much easier to accept a VR device from Nintendo. If it can ride on the boom, it might be an interesting development.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, Nintendo watchers are focused on its first smartphone game Miitomo, a character-based, social network-style service, that is scheduled to be launched next month. Investors are also pinning hopes that Nintendo will offer Mario Kart or Super Mario for its second mobile game title.\n\nFor a company whose most recent console, the WiiU, has delivered disappointing sales, the mobile gaming market figures had become increasingly compelling. At an estimated $7.5bn, Japan is the most valuable mobile games market, according to Deutsche Bank, which puts the worldwide market at $26bn.\n\nNintendo is working on a new console codenamed NX, although Mr Kimishima did not offer any fresh details.\n\nIn the third quarter, sales of Wii U console fell 2.1 per cent to 1.87m units, while sales of its 3DS handheld game device fell 28 per cent to 3.6m units.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u4e9a\u6d32,\u65e5\u672c,\u96f6\u552e,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a","industry":"\u96f6\u552e","area":"\u4e9a\u6d32,\u65e5\u672c","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1454428800","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/3\/000058473_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6125","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454403994","cheadline":"\u4f18\u9177\u571f\u8c46\u539f\u526f\u603b\u88c1\u88ab\u8b66\u65b9\u62d8\u7559","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"catchy|\u6717\u6717\u4e0a\u53e3\u7684['k\u00e6t\u0283\u026a]\ndetain|\u62d8\u7559[d\u026a'te\u026an]\ncorruption|\u8d2a\u6c61[k\u0259'r\u028cp\u0283(\u0259)n]\npeer-generated content|\u81ea\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\ncollude|\u52fe\u7ed3[k\u0259'l(j)u\u02d0d]\nkickback|\u56de\u6263['k\u026akb\u00e6k]\npave|\u5b89\u6392[pe\u026av]\nmarketing blitz|\u95ea\u7535\u5f0f\u8425\u9500","cshortleadbody":"\u53bb\u5e74\u8d77\u524d\u767e\u5ea6\u8054\u76df\u603b\u7ecf\u7406\u9a6c\u56fd\u6797\u88ab\u6293\u3001\u539f\u805a\u5212\u7b97\u603b\u7ecf\u7406\u960e\u5229\u73c9\u56e0\u53d7\u8d3f\u88ab\u52247\u5e74\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\uff0c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5de8\u5934\u8981\u5f00\u59cb\u4e60\u60ef\u5c06\u8fdd\u6cd5\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u6216\u524d\u5458\u5de5\u9001\u5165\u76d1\u72f1\u4e86\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhich one was produced by Lu Fanxi as mentioned?<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=rightanswer>\n\u5362\u68b5\u6eaa\u66fe\u662f\u4f18\u9177\u571f\u8c46\u81ea\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u5236\u4f5c\u6d41\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u95fb\u540d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u5305\u62ec\u64ad\u653e\u6b21\u6570\u5f88\u591a\u3001\u4f46\u6587\u827a\u754c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e0d\u9ad8\u7684\u6b4c\u66f2\u300a\u5c0f\u82f9\u679c\u300b\u3002 <\/div>\n<ul class=quizlist>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Gangnam Style <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=1> Little Apple  <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Go Princess <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Lost Tomb <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWho took over Youku in 2015?

Both men were in video production, were fingered by internal audits and turned over to police.\n\nThe popularity of Little Apple by the duo Chopstick Brothers helped pave the way for more peer-generated content to catch on at China\u2019s online video sites. It was the theme song to Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon, a film released in May 2014 and one of the first full productions financed by Youku Tudou.\n\nLargely due to Mr Lu\u2019s marketing blitz, as well as a combination of repetitive melodies and simple lyrics, it was an immediate hit on the internet and helped popularise a dance form known as square dancing.\n\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd,\u79d1\u6280,\u5a92\u4f53,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406","industry":"\u79d1\u6280,\u5a92\u4f53","area":"\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1454342400","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/6\/000058406_piclink.jpg"}}],"photonews":[{"photonewsid":"959","publish_status":"publish","en_title":"urban_parks_under_threat","cn_title":"\u57ce\u5e02\u516c\u56ed\u9762\u4e34\u5a01\u80c1","leadbody":"\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u4f11\u95f2\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5468\u8fb9\u623f\u4ef7\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5370\u8c61\u4e5f\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6cbf\u5cb8\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u516c\u56ed\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u6619\u82b1\u4e00\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u516c\u56ed\u9762\u4e34\u8d44\u91d1\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002","count_picture":"10","thumb_url":"photonews\/2016\/02\/56b46caabfe776.48427882.jpg","add_times":"1454688000","tags":"\u9ad8\u6e05,\u7ecf\u6d4e","adchannel":"","shortlead":"\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u7eff\u8272\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u4f11\u95f2\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5468\u8fb9\u623f\u4ef7\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u5370\u8c61\u4e5f\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5bf9\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u6cbf\u5cb8\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u516c\u56ed\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u6619\u82b1\u4e00\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u516c\u56ed\u9762\u4e34\u8d44\u91d1\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u3002","cover":"","icon":null,"illustration":null,"skyline":null},{"photonewsid":"958","publish_status":"publish","en_title":"martin_shkreli_appears_on_capitol_hill","cn_title":"\u53d7\u5ba1\u7684\u836f\u5546","leadbody":"\u66fe\u662f\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406\u7684\u9a6c\u4e01\u2022\u65af\u514b\u83b1\u91cc\uff08Martin
