request<\/b>\uff08526words\uff09\nBy Stephen Foley in New York and Tim Bradshaw in San Francisco\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nBill Gates has broken ranks with Silicon Valley in the stand-off between Apple and the US government, saying technology companies should be forced to co-operate with law enforcement in terrorism investigations.\n\nThe Microsoft founder took issue with Tim Cook\u2019s characterisation of the government\u2019s order that Apple help break open the San Bernardino shooter\u2019s iPhone as a demand for a \u201cback door\u201d, denying that it would set a wider precedent.\n\n \u201cThis is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case,\u201d Mr Gates told the Financial Times.\n\n\u201cIt is no different than [the question of] should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information, should anybody be able to get at bank records. Let\u2019s say the bank had tied a ribbon round the disk drive and said \u2018don\u2019t make me cut this ribbon because you\u2019ll make me cut it many times\u2019.\u201d\n\nApple has been pulled into a war of words with US law enforcement in the last week, after a judge ordered the company to write software that would enable FBI investigators to unlock Syed Rizwan Farook\u2019s iPhone. Mr Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has called the request a \u201cchilling\u201d example of \u201coverreach\u201d by the US government that would set a \u201cdangerous precedent that threatens everyone\u2019s civil liberties\u201d.\n\nMr Gates\u2019 stance sets him apart from the rest of the tech industry, including the company he founded. Satya Nadella, Microsoft chief, has not publicly commented on the matter, but a spokesperson for the Seattle-based company pointed to a statement by the Reform Government Surveillance organisation, of which it is a member, opposing the order.\n\nSilicon Valley executives including Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook chief; Jack Dorsey, Twitter founder; and Sundar Pichai, head of Google, have all sided with Mr Cook. National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden called the showdown \u201cthe most important tech case in a decade\u201d.\n\nBut James Comey, FBI director, has insisted that the case is \u201cquite narrow\u201d.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to break anyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land,\u201d Mr Comey wrote in a blogpost on Sunday night.\n\nMr Gates told the FT that there were benefits to the government being able to enforce taxation, stop crime and investigate terror threats, but said there must be rules on when the information can be accessed.\n\n\u201cI hope that we have that debate so that the safeguards are built and so people do not opt \u2014 and this will be country by country \u2014 [to say] it is better that the government does not have access to any information,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Gates was speaking at the launch of the annual letter from his charitable organisation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in which he argues that \u201can energy miracle\u201d will be needed to bring electricity to the one-fifth of the world\u2019s population that does not currently have it, while still reducing carbon emissions to zero.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s science the expletive-\t out of this,\u201d he said, quoting Matt Damon\u2019s character in the movie, The Martian. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the expletives are.\u201d\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u653f\u6cbb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u653f\u6cbb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269","industry":"\u4e92\u8054\u7f51","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1456156800","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/0\/000055860_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6215","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1456132751","cheadline":"Facebook\u65b0\u4f7f\u547d\uff1a\u5728VR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u793e\u4ea4","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"multiplayer|\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f['m\u028cltiplei\u0259]\nmingle|\u6df7\u5408\uff1b\u4ea4\u5f80['m\u026a\u014bg(\u0259)l]\nspherical|\u7403\u9762\u7684['sfer\u026ak(\u0259)l]\nvideoconference|\u53ef\u89c6\u4f1a\u8bae['v\u026ad\u026ao,k\u0251nf\u0259r\u0259ns]\nzombie|\u884c\u5c38\u8d70\u8089['z\u0252mb\u026a]","cshortleadbody":"\u5c06\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u4f7f\u7528FaceTime\u6216Skype\u4e0e\u8fdc\u65b9\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5e26\u4e0a\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u5934\u76d4\uff0c\u77ac\u95f4\u5c31\u8ba9\u4f60\u89c9\u5f97\u597d\u50cf\u4e0e\u670b\u53cb\u8eab\u5904\u4e00\u5ba4\u4e2d\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhen Oculus was acquired by Facebook?

Millions of people watch these 360 or \u201cspherical\u201d videos, which let the user pan around a scene to look in any direction they choose, every day on Facebook, it said. \n\nFacebook-owned Oculus has already experimented with bringing communication and social networking features through a \u201cSocial Alpha\u201d for its Gear VR headset, which lets small groups of people chat as they watch online videos together on a virtual cinema screen, and with Toybox, a Rift game which lets two people play table tennis and other games in a small room together. \n\nOn Sunday, Samsung unveiled a new 360-degree camera for taking spherical photographs that can be viewed in its Gear VR headset, alongside new versions of its Galaxy smartphones.\n\nOn stage at Samsung\u2019s press conference at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said that VR was the next step in online communications after text, photos and videos.\n\n\u201cVR is the next platform, where anyone can experience and share anything they want,\u201d he said, suggesting that friends and colleagues will gather around virtual campfires, watch movies in a private theatre or hold group meetings using the technology. \u201cVR is going to be the most social platform.\u201d\n\nHe added that Facebook had dedicated \u201chundreds of our best engineers\u201d to VR, to help create experiences that make \u201cyou feel like you\u2019re actually there\u201d with friends.\n\nFacebook\u2019s social VR team, working closely with Oculus\u2019s engineers and designers, will compete with several start-ups that have already tried to bring videoconferencing and social networking into VR, such as Silicon Valley\u2019s Altspace VR and vTime by UK-based digital studio Starship. Google is also investing heavily in VR, with a new smartphone-based headset said to launch later this year. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already helped people connect in a wide variety of ways on mobile devices \u2014 ranging from Facebook and Instagram to Messenger and WhatsApp \u2014 and now we want to apply that same approach to the new medium of VR,\u201d Facebook said in a blog

China<\/b>\uff08501words\uff09\nBy Charles Clover in Beijing and Leslie Hook in San Francisco\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nUber has revealed that it is losing more than $1bn a year in China, amid fierce competition from local ride-hailing rival Didi Kuaidi.\n\nBut Travis Kalanick, chief executive, insisted that Uber was in a better position than its Chinese rival because it was able to fund its losses, at least partly, by using profits from other countries.\n\n \u201cWe\u2019re profitable in the USA, but we\u2019re losing over $1bn a year in China,\u201d Mr Kalanick told Canadian technology news site Betakit. \u201cWe have a fierce competitor that\u2019s unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they\u2019re buying up market share. I wish the world wasn\u2019t that way.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Didi claimed that Mr Kalanick\u2019s comments on its financial performance were \u201coutright untrue\u201d and said its business had reached break-even in more than half of the 400 Chinese cities in which it operates.\n\nThis new war of words underscores the fierce battle between the two companies in China, where they are both spending heavily on discounts and promotions in pursuit of market share. Uber plans to double the number of Chinese cities in which it operates by the end of this year, to nearly 100.\n\nMr Kalanick\u2019s comments also give an indication of the money being spent. According to documents leaked to website The Information in January, Uber\u2019s global losses grew to nearly $1bn in the first half of last year, nearly 50 per cent more than its full-year losses in 2014. Uber declined to comment on the numbers, but Mr Kalanick told Betakit that the crucial difference between its business and Didi Kuaidi is its ability to offset China losses. Uber is the dominant ride-hailing company in most US markets, and it has pushed up revenues by increasing its booking fee and its commission in many US markets.\n\n\u201cI prefer building rather than fundraising,\u201d Mr Kalanick said in his interview. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t participate in the fundraising bonanza, I\u2019ll get squeezed out by others buying market share.\u201d\n\nUber has raised more than $10bn to date, and its investors include Goldman Sachs, TPG, Fidelity and \u2014 most recently \u2014 Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Didi Kuaidi raised $3bn in a fundraising round last year, bringing its total funds raised to more than $4bn from investors including CIC, China\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Alibaba, and Tencent. Didi has also been an active investor in Uber\u2019s competitors around the world, including Lyft in the US, and Grab in southeast Asia.\n\nBoth Uber and Didi have spent heavily on subsidies to drivers and riders in an effort to speed adoption and gain scale, in the hope that costs will fall as the number of drivers and riders increases.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for burning cash,\u201d said Jean Liu, Didi Kuaidi\u2019s president, last September. She argued that, by using subsidies to get more cars on the road, \u201cwaiting times were shortened, fares became cheaper, more users were drawn on to the platform \u2014 and drivers on the platform thus wouldn\u2019t require subsidies any longer\u201d.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u79d1\u6280,\u6c7d\u8f66,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406","industry":"\u79d1\u6280,\u6c7d\u8f66","area":"\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd","scoop":"4","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1455811200","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/0\/000056440_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6199","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1455788292","cheadline":"\u82f9\u679c\u62d2\u7edd\u4e3aFBI\u63d0\u4f9b\u7834\u89e3

encryption fight<\/b>\uff08705words\uff09\nBy Tim Bradshaw in San Francisco\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe chief executive of Google and the founder of WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned messaging service, have voiced their support for Apple in its fight with the FBI over encryption.\n\nApple has said it would challenge a federal court order to unblock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters, as the FBI tries to investigate their links to Isis militants.\n\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has condemned the bureau\u2019s demand to remove security features and write new operating system software, saying it was \u201can over-reach by the US government\u201d with \u201cchilling implications\u201d on customer privacy and security.\n\nMr Cook\u2019s tough stance won plaudits from privacy campaigners but Apple\u2019s peers and rivals in Silicon Valley initially remained silent on the issue.\n\nJan Koum, the co-founder of WhatsApp and a Facebook board member, was the first Silicon Valley executive to speak up in approval of Apple\u2019s position. In a Facebook post, Mr Koum said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t agree more with everything said in [Apple\u2019s] customer letter today\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake,\u201d Mr Koum wrote. Facebook itself has not commented on Apple\u2019s stance.\n\nLater on Wednesday afternoon, Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Alphabet subsidiary Google, also spoke up, calling Mr Cook\u2019s letter \u201cimportant\u201d.\n\n\u201cForcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users\u2019 privacy,\u201d Mr Pichai said in a series of tweets. While Google, like other tech companies, co-operates with law enforcement in criminal investigations, that is \u201cwholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data\u201d, he said, which \u201ccould be a troubling precedent\u201d.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s decision to take its row with Silicon Valley over encryption technology to the courts has been brewing for almost two years, after Apple introduced greater security and privacy controls to the iPhone with 2014\u2019s iOS 8 update.\n\nBy involving the San Bernardino case, Silicon Valley companies are forced to choose between abandoning their privacy principles and being seen as impeding an investigation into a terrorist attack.\n\n\u201cThe PR optics could not possibly be worse for Apple,\u201d wrote tech industry analyst Ben Thompson in a blog post. \u201cIt\u2019s a case of domestic terrorism with a clear cut bad guy and a warrant that no one could object to, and Apple is capable of fulfilling the request.\u201d\n\nDianne Feinstein, the California senator and vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that if Apple did not voluntarily comply with the order, she would put forward legislation to require it, after previous efforts to do so last year failed.\n\n\u201cWe have had this terrorist act in my state where 14 people were killed, and there is a phone encrypted that could yield additional information,\u201d Sen Feinstein told CNN. \u201cAnd I believe that, as a government, we have every responsibility and duty to see that Apple provides that information.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at an MSNBC town hall, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said: \u201cI think it is disgraceful that Apple is not helping\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we should force them to do it.\u201d\n\nBut others in Washington sided with Apple.\n\nRon Wyden, US senator for Oregon, said the FBI\u2019s request was \u201cbad for Americans\u2019 online safety and security\u201d and could \u201cempower repressive regimes\u201d by giving them a \u201cblueprint\u201d for how to evade encryption.\n\n\u201cThis unprecedented reading of a nearly 230-year-old law would create a dangerous precedent that would put at risk the foundations of strong security for our people and privacy in the digital age,\u201d he said in a longer message posted to Twitter. \u201cThis move by the FBI could snowball around the world.\u201d\n\nTech industry groups have also supported Apple.\n\n\u201cIf governments compel tech companies to weaken the security that users demand, they are also creating the vulnerabilities that hackers, terrorists or other nefarious actors need,\u201d said Computer & Communications Industry Association president Ed Black.\n\nThe Software and Information Industry Association agreed that the order against Apple would do \u201cmore harm than good\u201d.\n\nAlex Abdo, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government request \u201crisks setting a dangerous precedent\u201d. \u201cIf the FBI can force Apple to hack into its customers\u2019 devices, then so too can every repressive regime in the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u653f\u6cbb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u653f\u6cbb,\u79d1\u6280","industry":"\u4e92\u8054\u7f51","area":"","scoop":"4","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1455724800","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/1\/000058811_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6190","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1455701772","cheadline":"\u5185\u9a6c\u5c14\u518d\u9677\u5077\u7a0e\u98ce\u6ce2","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"seizure|\u6ca1\u6536['si\u02d0\u0292\u0259]\nyacht|\u6e38\u8247[j\u0252t]\nomission|\u758f\u6f0f[\u0259(\u028a)'m\u026a\u0283(\u0259)n]\nembolden|\u4f7f\u5927\u80c6[\u026am'b\u0259\u028ald(\u0259)n;

He is also at the centre of a separate case in Spain over alleged irregularities in his transfer from Santos to Barcelona, the reigning European champions.\n\n\u201cThere were omissions of revenue received from sources inside and outside the national territory,\u201d said the court ruling from a federal judge in Santos.\n\nThe case against Neymar, who like most Brazilian footballers is generally known by his first name, comes as the country\u2019s elites face increasing scrutiny from regulatory authorities.\n\nJudges in Brazil have been emboldened by the success of the so-called Lava Jato \u2014 Car Wash \u2014 corruption case, in which former executives of state-owned oil company Petrobras have been accused of conspiring with politicians to secure bribes from contractors.\n\nThe multibillion-dollar scandal has led to the arrests of senior politicians, executives and bankers, surprising many Brazilians who were accustomed to a culture of impunity for the rich and powerful.\n\nNeymar was Brazil\u2019s top scorer in the 2014 World Cup, netting four goals before injury forced him out. His absence preceded the \u201cgoleada\u201d, or thrashing, in the semi-finals, when Brazil was beaten 7-1 by the eventual winners Germany.\n\nUpholding an earlier court decision, the federal judge in Santos presiding over the case against Neymar ordered him to repay about R$63.6m in taxes he allegedly avoided, or a total of R$192.8m including fines and interest on the amount unpaid.\n\nThe court ordered that aside from his Phenom private jet, made by Brazi\u2019s Embraer, authorities should seize properties and vehicles owned by the footballer up to a total value equalling the amount he owes in tax, a statement from the court said.\n\nProsecutors allege the star used marketing and other shell companies to distribute his earnings in such a way that he paid less tax.\n\nNeymar\u2019s lawyer was unavailable for comment. But the footballer has been contesting the case.\n\nBrazilians have seen an increase in cases of the seizure of goods from the super-rich. In the most spectacular last year, police raided the homes of Eike Batista, once Brazil\u2019s richest man, taking a yacht and cars after he was accused of insider trading.\n\nIn a separate move related to the Petrobras case, they also raided the home of Fernando Collor, the former president, seizing three sports cars \u2014 a Ferrari, a Porsche and a Lamborghini.\n\nHowever, the confiscation of Mr Batista\u2019s goods ended in farce after the judge who ordered the move was later seen driving a Porsche appropriated from the billionaire around Rio de Janeiro. A search of the judge\u2019s apartment complex later revealed he had also taken the billionaire\u2019s grand piano and other luxury cars.\n\nNeymar has spearheaded Barcelona\u2019s push to retain the European Champions League and the Spanish league titles, alongside Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi and the Uruguayan Luis Su\u00e1rez.\n\nMr Messi is also due to face trial in Spain alongside his father, Jorge, over allegations of tax fraud. The 28 year-old, widely regarded as the world\u2019s best player, and his father have been under investigation over allegations of tax evasion since 2013.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u4eba\u7269,\u4f53\u80b2,\u8db3\u7403,\u91d1\u878d,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u4eba\u7269,\u4f53\u80b2,\u8db3\u7403","industry":"\u91d1\u878d","area":"","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"007000061","pubdate":"1455638400","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/4\/000058754_piclink.jpg"}}],"photonews":[{"photonewsid":"967","publish_status":"publish","en_title":"new_york_after_dark","cn_title":"\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4e0d\u591c\u57ce","leadbody":"\u66fe\u88ab\u5965\u5df4\u9a6c\u201c\u70b9\u8d5e\u201d\u7684\u667a\u5229\u6444\u5f71\u5e08Camilo Jos\u00e9 Vergara\u64c5\u957f\u5efa\u7b51\u6444\u5f71\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u56fe\u8f91\u6536\u5f55\u4e86\u51cc\u66681\u70b9\u5230\u65e5\u51fa\u4e4b\u524d\u8fd9\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4Vergara \u773c\u4e2d\u201c\u4ece\u4e0d\u4f11\u7720\u201d\u7684\u7ebd\u7ea6\u57ce\u3002","count_picture":"13","thumb_url":"photonews\/2016\/02\/56cc1c961c73d8.64637730.jpg","add_times":"1456156800","tags":"\u9ad8\u6e05,\u7f8e\u56fd","adchannel":"","shortlead":"1970\u5e74\u4ee3\u4ee5\u6765Vergara\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8bb0\u5f55\u7f8e\u56fd\u571f\u5730\u4e0a\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u52a0\u5dde\u5230\u5e95\u7279\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ece\u7ebd\u74e6\u514b\u5230\u7ebd\u7ea6\u3002","cover":"","icon":null,"illustration":null,"skyline":null},{"photonewsid":"966","publish_status":"publish","en_title":"south_carolina_republican_primary","cn_title":"\u5357\u5361\u7f57\u6765\u7eb3\u5dde\u5171\u548c\u515a\u521d\u9009\u73b0\u573a","leadbody":"\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bcc\u8c6a\u7279\u6717\u666e\u83b7\u5f97\u8be5\u5dde33%\u7684\u9009\u7968\uff0c\u5362\u6bd4\u5965\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e\u514b\u9c81\u5179\u4f4d\u5c45\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7387\u5747\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e22%\u3002\u4ec5\u83b7\u5f977.8%\u9009\u7968\u7684\u6770\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u9000\u51fa\u7ade\u9009\u3002","count_picture":"8","thumb_url":"photonews\/2016\/02\/56cac5b645acb0.31511022.jpg","add_times":"1456070400","tags":"\u9ad8\u6e05,\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u9009","adchannel":"","shortlead":"\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bcc\u8c6a\u7279\u6717\u666e\u83b7\u5f97\u8be5\u5dde33%\u7684\u9009\u7968\uff0c\u5362\u6bd4\u5965\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e\u514b\u9c81\u5179\u4f4d\u5c45\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7387\u5747\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e22%\u3002\u4ec5\u83b7\u5f977.8%\u9009\u7968\u7684\u6770\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u9000\u51fa\u7ade\u9009\u3002","cover":"photonews\/2016\/02\/56cac5b65310a8.26073438.jpg","icon":null,"illustration":null,"skyline":null},{"photonewsid":"965","publish_status":"publish","en_title":"from_gdansk_shipyard_to_applause_from_presidents","cn_title":"\u83b1\u8d6b\u2022\u74e6\u6587\u8428\uff1a\u4ece\u9020\u8239\u5382\u8d70\u5411\u603b\u7edf","leadbody":"\u8fd1\u65e5\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\u63f4\u5f15\u91cd\u89c1\u5929\u65e5\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u56fd\u524d\u603b\u7edf\u3001\u5f53\u5e74\u53cd\u5171\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u82f1\u96c4\u83b1\u8d6b\u2022\u74e6\u6587\u8428(Lech Walesa)\u66fe\u662f\u82cf\u8054\u65f6\u4ee3\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u6709\u507f\u7ebf\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u57281980\u5e74\u521b\u7acb\u56e2\u7ed3\u5de5\u4f1a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6ce2\u5170\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u53ca\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u52301989\u5e74\u4e1c\u6b27\u53d8\u5929\uff0c\u6ce2\u5170\u5171\u4ea7\u653f\u6743\u5012\u53f0\uff0c\u74e6\u6587\u84281990\u5e74\u81f31995\u5e74\u51fa\u4efb\u603b\u7edf\u3002","count_picture":"5","thumb_url":"photonews\/2016\/02\/56c6cc6faca121.41109080.jpg","add_times":"1455811200","tags":"\u9ad8\u6e05,\u653f\u6cbb","adchannel":"","shortlead":"\u8fd1\u65e5\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\u63f4\u5f15\u91cd\u89c1\u5929\u65e5\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u56fd\u524d\u603b\u7edf\u3001\u5f53\u5e74\u53cd\u5171\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u82f1\u96c4\u83b1\u8d6b\u2022\u74e6\u6587\u8428(Lech Walesa)\u66fe\u662f\u82cf\u8054\u65f6\u4ee3\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u6709\u507f\u7ebf\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u57281980\u5e74\u521b\u7acb\u56e2\u7ed3\u5de5\u4f1a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6ce2\u5170\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u53ca\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u52301989\u5e74\u4e1c\u6b27\u53d8\u5929\uff0c\u6ce2\u5170\u5171\u4ea7\u653f\u6743\u5012\u53f0\uff0c\u74e6\u6587\u84281990\u5e74\u81f31995\u5e74\u51fa\u4efb\u603b\u7edf\u3002","cover":"","icon":null,"illustration":null,"skyline":null}]}
