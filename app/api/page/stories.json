      "ebody": "<p>In mid-2008, when every headline was screaming market meltdown and the end of financial life as the world knew it, Hiromitsu Nakauchi spotted an old friend at a school reunion.</p>\n<p>Dr Nakauchi, professor of stem cell therapy at the Tokyo University Institute of Medical Science, had not seen much of Genjiro Miwa since the two left Azabu High decades earlier. But he knew his old friend’s career had something to do with investment. “Look at what is happening! You finance people have done so many terrible things,” the regenerative medicine pioneer told him. “It’s time you finally did something to make the world better.”</p>\n<p>Almost a decade later, the company that the two men agreed to set up just a few weeks after that conversation is claiming a breakthrough that could transform the lives of millions across the world who have no access to reliable supplies of blood platelets — an essential treatment for some cancer patients and accident victims. It could also rescue Japan from a health crisis as it runs out of younger blood donors.</p>\n<p>Megakaryon, the company that they formally founded in 2011, sits at the heart of a spiralling Japanese obsession with stem-cell based regenerative medicine. Almost 12 per cent, and rising, of the state’s ¥126bn ($1.15bn) discretionary medical research budget is now channelled into the area amid fears that the country could lose its leading edge to the US or another rival.</p>\n<p>There is particular excitement about induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells, which are created by removing mature cells from an individual — typically from the skin — and biochemically reprogramming them back to an embryo-like state. They can then be transformed into any type of cell needed to treat diseases. Early clinical applications range from making neurons to replace failing brain cells in Parkinson’s disease patients, to retinal cells to rescue the sight of people going blind.</p>\n<p>The invention of iPS cells in Japan 10 years ago caused a scientific sensation, because it offered several advantages over the embryonic stem cells then being developed for regenerative medicine. For instance, they do not require the creation and destruction of human embryos, which some find ethically troublesome, and iPS cells made from a patient’s own cells are a perfect genetic match to his or her immune system, ensuring a higher success rate.</p>\n<p>Last month, Megakaryon provided details of what it says is the world’s first process for mass-producing clotting platelets from iPS cells — essentially a blueprint for artificial blood factories. Clinical trials are due to begin in Japan and the US next year, in Europe the year after, and if all goes well the products may be routinely flowing in patients’ arteries by 2020.</p>\n<p>The Kyoto-based company has not blazed this trail alone. In a country that is often described as difficult for entrepreneurs, dozens of iPS-related start-ups have exploded from the Kyoto hub, stimulated partly by state money. “There is a belief that stretches from basic researchers to government ministries that Japan is leading the world in creating a new industry around iPS,” says Mr Miwa.</p>\n<p>Megakaryon is technically a private company. But one of its largest investors is the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan, a state-backed promoter of industries that the powerful trade ministry (METI) regards as important — and so the sense of national mission is everywhere. One bureaucrat involved in funding iPS projects describes Japan’s love affair with the field as the country’s own “Apollo moonshot”.</p>\n<p>For all that iPS has re-ignited Japan’s fervour for cutting-edge scientific adventure and global competition, many scientists fear it could still become a victim of familiar failings: burdensome regulation, excessive government interference and a lack of nimble thinking from big business.</p>\n<p>Looming over that are the broader risks that accompany any pioneering scientific endeavour: expensive cul-de-sacs, ferocious global competition, the threat of “leapfrogging” by a rival and, more fundamentally, whether you are backing the right horse.</p>\n<p>Dr Nakauchi’s original plea to his old school friend, recalls Mr Miwa, was borne out of a fear that if he did not secure investment and create a business, Japan would fall behind foreign rivals in iPS despite discovering the technology.</p>\n<p>By 2013, when Dr Nakauchi opened a laboratory in Stanford to conduct experiments not possible under domestic law, Japanese media turned on their hero and accused him of “making off” with the nation’s iPS treasure. Four years later, despite repeated claims that regulatory loosening was coming, Dr Nakauchi conducts his interview with the Financial Times from a lab in Stanford as new avenues of regenerative medicine and experiments on larger animals are still not permitted in Japan.</p>\n<p>What started in 2007 as Japan’s cautious excitement over the human iPS cells as both a “made in Japan” source of new therapies and a powerful accelerant for drug development has been transformed into an article of national faith. The discovery, say trade ministry officials, was the antidote to a feeling that Japan was losing ground to China and its broader technological edge in areas from science to consumer electronics.</p>\n<p>The awarding of the 2012 Nobel medicine prize to Shinya Yamanaka, who invented iPS cells a few miles away from Megakaryon’s labs, has redoubled Japan’s determination to mark this territory as its own. Prof Yamanaka suspects that the “home advantage” of inventing iPS does not in itself give Japanese researchers an edge over US and European rivals, yet he is satisfied the country is currently in the lead on regenerative medicine using iPS cells.</p>\n<p>To bolster that position hefty public and corporate research budgets have been funnelled towards iPS projects. Megakaryon is now working with a consortium of 15 Japanese industrial groups including Otsuka Pharmaceutical and Nissan Chemical Industries. A government agency has been created, in part to marshal the bureaucratic might of the state into regenerative medicine.</p>\n<p>The rewards, too, are starting to flow as pressure builds from cash-conscious Japanese universities to convert years of generously funded science into commercial products. In March, Masayo Takahashi, a central figure in Japan’s tight group of iPS pioneers, successfully transplanted iPS-derived retinal cells into the eye of a patient suffering from macular degeneration.</p>\n<p>“iPS was invented in Japan. The government loves them. Researchers love them. Everyone wants to promote that, and the ministries are trying to make regulation easier,” she says. “Research budgets in Japan may have declined in general over the past 10 years, but funding for iPS has been strong.”</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, another Kyoto-based team led by Professor Junya Toguchida unveiled a schedule of clinical trials of the world’s first drug developed through testing on human iPS cells to treat a rare bone disease. “The key for Japan to keep its leadership position in drug discovery is to form effective collaboration between researchers and pharmaceutical companies,” Prof Toguchida says, adding that even he could not believe how significantly iPS technology was accelerating drug discovery processes.</p>\n<p>Last week, another team at Kyoto University, led by Jun Takahashi, published research in Nature demonstrating that neurons derived from human iPS cells relieved symptoms of Parkinson’s when transplanted into monkeys’ brains — a vital step in using stem-cell technology to fight the disease.</p>\n<p>Japan’s leadership in the field depends partly on the government’s continued financial support but also on its future interaction with other fields like robotics in which Japan excels.</p>\n<p>Megakaryon was founded to address a problem faced by the world in general and in particular by Japan, which has the world’s fastest-ageing population. In 10 years, says Dr Nakauchi, the country will run short of blood platelets because there will be fewer donors and more cancer patients.</p>\n<p>Unlike other resources where Japan has faced shortages, from oil to lithium, platelets cannot be imported or stored for long. The iPS cell, he says, is a beautiful solution. With the clinical challenges now solved, the next step is mass production — an engineering and industrial issue where the government has pulled together a consortium of companies.</p>\n<p>Other regenerative medicine developments arising from the platelet work, such as using iPS cells to generate human organ factories, have hit against Japanese regulation.</p>\n<p>“We have proof of principle in rats and mice but now we need to test it in larger animals like pigs. I’ve been asking Japan to amend the guidelines for six years and the committee at the highest level agreed [to do that] three years ago but there has still not been a change,” says Dr Nakauchi.</p>\n<p>Education ministry officials directly involved in promoting the field warn that regulation represents one of the biggest hurdles to Japan maintaining its lead in the field. Yet observers overseas see no cause for Japanese concern.</p>\n<p>“It is not just about money,” says Keith Thompson, chief executive of the UK Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, an initiative to promote human cell manufacturing. “They have a good position in intellectual property, and they have shaken up their regulatory system to make it easier to get stem cell products into the clinic.”</p>\n<p>An expert panel on bioethics has been convened under the Cabinet Office of Shinzo Abe to examine ways of bending guidelines to the benefit of Megakaryon and others, but concerns have been raised about how committed the prime minister is to the scheme. “It’s not that Abe is totally unaware of the issue but we don’t see he has shown high interest,” says one closely involved official.</p>\n<p>But Makoto Suematsu, president of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), disagrees. AMED, created on the instructions of Mr Abe in late 2014, is tasked with tackling the biggest systemic constraint on Japanese regenerative medicine: the lack of co-operation between the three key ministries, education, health and trade, involved in research funding.</p>\n<p>By directing its own $500m budget, AMED has been asked to tackle the dramatic imbalance that means that the ministry of education funds 70 per cent of research while the health ministry funds just 30 per cent, skewing the finances towards basic research rather than the now more important task of producing clinical outcomes.</p>\n<p>Yet seen from outside, Japan has an enviable lead in the race to commercialise iPS cells. Dusko Ilic, a stem cell scientist at King’s College London, says the country has no need to worry. “There is no doubting Japanese dominance of the field. The cutting-edge science is there and so is the corporate activity. No one else is even close.”</p>",

      "ebody": "<b>Why ‘Let it Go’ is loved by prisoners and preschoolers alike</b>（650 words）\nBy Helen Brown\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThis March a charity running singing workshops at prisons across the UK announced that the most popular song among inmates was “Let it Go”, the big number from Disney’s 2013 animated blockbuster, Frozen.\n\nDespite the superficial incongruity of old lags carolling along to a song more commonly associated with preschoolers dressed as animated princesses, anyone alive to the profound emotional truths of the film would not be surprised to find it resonating with prisoners struggling to own the guilt and shame of the past and yearning to move on.\n\nFor the few souls who have still not seen Frozen, “Let it Go” is delivered by the character of Elsa on the day she is crowned Queen of Arendelle. As a child, little Elsa developed magical powers to create ice and snow, with which she accidentally hurt her sister, Anna. So her parents locked her up in their castle, teaching her to control and conceal her dangerous gift. But an emotional upset at her coronation exposes her “witchcraft” and turns her subjects against her. She flees Arendelle — the force of her fear and anger leaving eternal winter in her wake — and delivers “Let it Go” as she strides into the mountains where she finally unleashes her powers to build a dazzling ice palace, create a sexy new outfit and shut herself away from a world she kisses off with a defiant shrug of a line: “The cold never bothered me anyway.”\n\nBased on the fairy tale of The Snow Queen, Elsa was originally written as a villain. But when Broadway songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez set out to write “Elsa’s Badass Song”, the couple realised they were writing “a transformation song”, which Elsa begins as a vulnerable girl and ends as a powerful woman.\n\n“Who doesn’t have something there?” says Anderson-Lopez. “Shame or a secret that keeps them from owning their own power? We dug into that and imagined how it would feel at a much higher level.” The film was re-written to suit the song, making Elsa a flawed heroine, saved by the true love of her sister (not the traditional Prince Charming).\n\nMelodically, the song circles the sadness of minor chords and blasts exhilaration through the majors. Its unusual structure includes phases of ballad and soft rock with an orchestral centrepiece, ending on a lingering, unresolved chord. Its vocabulary is unpatronisingly advanced, with Elsa’s soul “spiralling in frozen fractals all around/ And one thought crystallises like an icy blast/ I’m never going back, the past is in the past!” That last, long, high exclamation was written for the dynamic vocal range of Broadway powerhouse Idina Menzel, whose in-film version massively outsold Demi Lovato’s poppier version  which Disney had expected to be the big single.\n\nIt was inevitable that children would connect with the song’s bold expression of latent power. But they weren’t alone. The internet filled up with tributes and parodies. Frazzled mums converted the chorus to “Fuck it all!” and dads pleaded “Let it go/I’m gonna smash the radio”. It became a coming out anthem for those expressing LGBT feelings, suffering from mental illness or on the autistic spectrum (like Andersen-Lopez’s younger brother).\n\nTo bawl along is pure release: the official singalong version has racked up more than 1bn YouTube views, almost double that of the standard version. It’s the most successful Disney song of all time, in the highest grossing animated movie (and third highest grossing movie) of all time.\n\nIt’s been recorded in over 40 languages and almost every genre, although (with the exception of a patchy live effort by Pearl Jam in 2014) major artists have steered clear, knowing this one’s for the fans.\n\nBrighton folk rocker Passenger does regularly receive requests for it at gigs, from people muddling it with his 2012 hit, “Let Her Go”. Anybody interested in how those two songs sound when spliced together should check out the glorious mash-up by YouTuber Sam Tsui. It’ll give you shivers.",

      "ebody": "<p>In December 1970 Led Zeppelin’s drummer John Bonham had just taken delivery of a brand new Ludwig drum kit. It was about to get a hell of a hammering.</p>\n<p>He and the band were recording their fourth album at Headley Grange, a former poorhouse in Hampshire, and they were seeking a special kind of drum sound for a song called “When the Levee Breaks”: something big, something epic.</p>\n<p>There’s a long tradition of British recording artists employing a domestic approach to the creation of distinctive sonic effects: 1960s producer and songwriter Joe Meek (of “Telstar” fame) used the bathroom of his rented flat on London’s Holloway Road to record vocals; Ringo Starr stretched tea towels over his drums to achieve a muffled effect.</p>\n<p>Zeppelin’s solution was to place the drum kit at the foot of Headley Grange’s three-storey stairwell and hang microphones from the top, thus exploiting the structure’s natural reverberative qualities. The result is one of the heaviest — and most heavily sampled — drum tracks ever recorded: Bonham locks down a groove that is truly massive, his limbs pumping like steam-driven pistons as bass drum and snare whump and rattle, with the occasional splash of cymbal shimmering. And the track itself is one of Zeppelin’s finest moments, a draggy, druggy haze of drums, guitar, vocals and backwards-recorded harmonica; a swirling, hypnotic vortex of heavily treated sound — no wonder they almost never played it live.</p>\n<p>The song’s origins, though, are more modest. Guitarist Jimmy Page had emerged from the British blues boom of the 1960s with The Yardbirds before forming Led Zeppelin in 1968, and “When the Levee Breaks” — like a fair amount of Zeppelin’s material — had its origins in the American blues: in this case, an old tune of the same title by Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie; released in 1929, the duo’s song recalls the devastating Mississippi floods of 1927. With its briskly strummed guitars, McCoy and Minnie’s song has an almost jaunty quality that is at odds with its subject matter (“Mean ol’ levee, cause me to weep and moan,” sings McCoy).</p>\n<p>Zeppelin had got themselves into trouble on an earlier album by failing to properly credit Howlin’ Wolf’s “Killing Floor” as a key component in “The Lemon Song” (Wolf’s music publisher sued; the parties settled out of court), and the band were dogged by accusations that they ripped off blues acts. In the case of “When the Levee Breaks”, though, the credits were given as Page/Plant/Jones/Bonham/Memphis Minnie.</p>\n<p>The label for the 1929 Columbia disc of the song has a couple of bits of printed description: “Guitar accomp.” and “Electrical process”. But the real “electrical process” came in the 1960s and early 1970s when bands such as Cream, John Mayall’s Bluesbreakers, Fleetwood Mac and Zeppelin plugged the blues into the mains and broadcast it to a new audience of white kids. Essentially, what Zeppelin and the other British blues-based bands were doing was a kind of sampling: taking a song, or an element of a song, and working it into something radically new.</p>\n<p>So there is a satisfying karmic circularity to the fact that Bonham’s drum track was subsequently picked up and sampled by dozens of US hip-hop acts, who clearly relished its pulverising groove: The Beastie Boys on “Rhymin’ & Stealin’” (1986); MC Lyte’s “Survival of the Fittest” (1989); Dr Dre on “Lyrical Gangbang” from his 1992 album The Chronic; Eminem on “Kim” (2000). (Bristol trip-hoppers Massive Attack also used it on 1998’s “Man Next Door”.) And all because, at Headley Grange in 1970, John Bonham had been stationed in a stairwell to musical heaven.</p>\n\n\n<p><em>Photograph: Getty Images</em>\n</p>\n<p><em>For more in the series, as well as podcasts with clips from the songs, visit <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/life-of-a-song\" title=\"Life of a Song - FT.com\">ft.com/life-of-a-song</a>\n</em>\n</p>",

      "ebody": "<b>Apple tests customer loyalty with $1,000 iPhone</b>（511 words）\nBy Tim Bradshaw\n-----------------------------------------------------\nApple will this week test its customers’ loyalty, buying power and enthusiasm for innovation when it unveils the first iPhone to cost as much as $1,000. \n\nTuesday’s event at Apple’s new Cupertino headquarters is expected to reveal its much-anticipated 10th-anniversary iPhone, offering significant upgrades to the smartphone’s display, camera and overall design. \n\nThe high-end model is an addition to Apple’s line-up, alongside more incremental updates to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus released last year. \n\nAnalysts believe the launch will help Apple to overcome its growth problem of the last two years. In markets such as America and Europe, where smartphone ownership is close to saturation and many customers are holding on to their existing handsets for longer, the best way to drive faster revenue growth is by charging more for each device, rather than simply relying on unit growth. \n\nAt the same time, Apple is bringing in costly new components. These include an OLED display that makes the front of the phone into one continuous screen. Depth-sensing cameras will offer new “augmented reality” features and allow the device to be unlocked by face recognition, instead of fingerprint. \n\nMore advanced components are in short supply, however, which could leave many customers waiting long after September to get hold of the new iPhone. That presents an opportunity for rivals such as Samsung’s new Note 8 or Essential, the smartphone maker led by Android co-founder Andy Rubin, which is targeting premium customers such as Apple’s with its slick $699 device. Google is also said to be preparing a new version of its Pixel smartphone, which has proved popular with early adopters. \n\nA survey by Creative Strategies and SurveyMonkey found that 21 per cent of consumers planning to buy the new iPhone would do so however much it cost, although 33 per cent of existing iPhone users said they would not upgrade if it was too expensive. \n\nAnalysts at Citi Research expect the “bill of materials” and assembly costs for the special-edition model to be $100 higher than for today’s iPhone 7, at an estimated $387. Half of that extra cost is due to the OLED display, which is available in more limited quantities from supplier Samsung Electronics than the LCD screens in previous iPhones. \n\nTo retain its gross margin of about 46 per cent, Wayne Lam of research group IHS predicts Apple will be forced to price the device at about $1,000. \n\n“It is no secret that Apple has the highest profit margins in history,” he said. “This year will test the price elasticity of regular consumers.” \n\nSome customers are prepared to pay more for their smartphones because the device has become so central to their daily lives, analysts say. Other smartphone makers are taking advantage of that: Samsung’s Galaxy Note 8, released next week, costs $960. \n\nStill, it is more than most people spend on a PC these days. “Given that phones don’t necessarily last more than two years, it’s a big investment,” Mr Lam said. “There is an economic reckoning that needs to be had with the ever-increasing costs of devices.”",

      "ebody": "<p>What is your most valuable asset?</p>\n<p>If you take the question in monetary terms, the answer is probably your house. Equally, you could say it was your health, family, time — or your brain. Yet according to a new book by Carmine Gallo, a former journalist, your most valuable asset is none of the above. It is your story.</p>\n<p>Although I have the greatest respect for my own story, as I plunder it often enough in my columns, to see it as my most valuable asset is idiotic. It shows the storytelling craze has gone too far.</p>\n<p>I first wrote about the fad more than a decade ago. I remember ridiculing an earnest American who had written a book, Around the Corporate Campfire, in which she urged people to “develop red-hot, value-based stories that spread like wildfire and propel them toward their vision”.</p>\n<p>She was right about the wildfire. Indeed, the corporate campfire has spread so dangerously, it is time to call the fire brigade.</p>\n<p>I know a bit about stories as I’m a storyteller by profession. That is to say, I am a journalist, and stories are what we produce. Yet now everyone is a storyteller. Doctors no longer exist merely to diagnose brain tumours; they are meant to tell stories too. Architects are supposed to be doing the same. The latter is particularly irritating to me, as I live in a house designed by a visionary architect that leaks every time it rains — making me long for less focus on stories, and more on designing structures that are watertight.</p>\n<p>Even mathematicians and scientists are now urged to present their work as stories. Most preposterous of all, the craze has spread to auditors.</p>\n<p>The head of HR at KPMG recently wrote a blog in which he proudly described his firm’s ‘higher purpose initiative’ — which has resulted in employees sending in 42,000 personal stories about how they are changing the world. You could say this was heart-warming, though as KPMG was the firm that did the audits on HBOS, Countrywide Financial and Quindell, one worries that it is being distracted from the lower purpose of doing the day job competently.</p>\n<p>Yet what distresses me most is that big name novelists are getting behind the fad. If a few impoverished writers are fleecing story-crazed corporates, that is fine. But last week I read in Fast Company that Mohsin Hamid, author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist, has become chief storytelling officer at the image consultancy Wolff Olins. This is as sad as it is inexplicable. How could the man who wrote the brilliantly funny How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia accept such a pompous, ludicrous title? Storytellers can never be a chief anything, let alone an officer. They have no place in the C-suite.</p>\n<p>There is an inverse relationship between how often companies talk about storytelling and their ability to use words nicely. Job advertisements now routinely specify “outstanding storytelling skillsets”, while on LinkedIn a company called DialogTech is looking for a chief storyteller who “will create creative and innovative marketing material that resonates with our target audience and compels them to engage with our brand across multiple touchpoints”. Bingo: 14 clichéd words in one sentence.</p>\n<p>Stories in the right place are an excellent thing. The Bible has some pretty good ones. Every journalist knows that if you have to write a dull article about tax changes you must leaven it by finding a real person to emote about how the change will render their life impossible/fantastic.</p>\n<p>We all like stories because we like emotion, and because they are easy for our befuddled brains to follow. They liven things up. They cheer us up. They can inspire us.</p>\n<p>This is to state the obvious. There is nothing magic about it. There is no need for a fad, or for Gallo in The Storyteller’s Secret to peddle the standard neurological guff about how “masterful storytelling triggers neurochemicals in our brains to pay attention (cortisol) and to feel empathy (oxytocin)”.</p>\n<p>The trouble with stories is that to have any effect they have to be good ones — and most people are rubbish at telling them. A further problem is that the more interesting you make them, the less likely they are to be true.</p>\n<p>At the start of this column I said everyone was a storyteller. That turns out to be a tall story. After tireless work on Google I have found two occupations that are still strangers to storytelling — plumbers and dentists.</p>\n<p>This stands to reason. If you need a root canal you most emphatically do not want a story; you want someone who can master one of those super-skinny dental drills. Ditto with plumbing. Plumbers don’t tell stories because they are too busy unblocking your toilet.</p>\n<p>That the corporate world is so very badly in need of storytellers is a very bad sign. It shows that we don’t think our jobs are enough without them.</p>\n\n\n<p><a title=\"Email the writer\" href=\"mailto:lucy.kellaway@ft.com\"><span class=\"ft-italic\">lucy.kellaway@ft.com</span>\n</a>\n<br/>\n<span class=\"ft-italic\">Twitter: <a title=\"Lucy Kellaway on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lucykellaway\">@lucykellaway</a>\n</span>\n</p>",
