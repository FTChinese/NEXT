says NHS <\/b>\uff08409words\uff09\nBy  Sarah Neville, Public Policy Editor\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nDemand for nurses has grown so rapidly that England\u2019s hospitals are now 15,000 short of the number they need, according to an official NHS assessment.\n\nNHS Improvement, the health regulator, also identified significant shortages of consultants in emergency medicine and general medicine.\n\nThe report says the findings of the Francis inquiry into serious care failings at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust have driven the recruitment of more nurses. Some of the lapses at the hospitals, where it is thought patients died needlessly, were blamed on too few nurses.\n\nThe report says hospitals\u2019 demand for nurses caring for adult acute patients in 2014 was 189,000, about 7,000 more than hospitals had been forecasting just a year earlier and 24,000 more than had been forecast two years before.\n\nNHS Improvement says a significant factor in the shortfall in supply is the collapse in the number of nurses from outside Europe joining the health service owing to restrictions on international recruitment.\n\nThe number of nurses joining through this route has fallen by over 95 per cent from its peak of more than 15,000 in the early 2000s.\n\nThe NHS submitted evidence to the Migration Advisory Committee in September 2015 calling for nurses to be exempted from the restrictions and pointing to wider evidence of nurse shortages across the NHS. Last October, restrictions were temporarily relaxed and the committee is due to publish a fuller review this month.\n\nNHS Improvement says the supply shortfall has inevitably driven up the cost of agency nurses. The bill for these temporary staff increased by about 30 per cent from 2012 to 2015.\n\nShortages of consultants are also highlighted in the report, with 73 per cent of providers\u2019 total spending on locum staff concentrated in these two areas, it says.\n\nHowever, NHS Improvement notes that reductions in the average length of hospital stay have helped to offset a sharp increase in hospital admissions during the past two years.\n\n\u201cWithout this improvement, there would likely be a need for around 5,000 extra nurses at a cost to the NHS of about \u00a3250m at agency rates,\u201d it adds.\n\nNHS Improvement says it is now working to help hospitals reduce the amount they are spending on agency staff through better workforce planning.\n\nIt is also implementing recommendations from a review into NHS productivity by Lord Carter of Coles, which called for a range of actions including using the central buying power of the NHS to save money on procurement.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd,\u533b\u7597,\u79fb\u6c11","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a","industry":"\u533b\u7597","area":"\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd","scoop":"2","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1455552000","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/0\/000058710_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6174","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1455526732","cheadline":"\u88ab\u76ef\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9c\u5bb6","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"breach|\u8fdd\u80cc[bri\u02d0t\u0283]\nfacilitate|\u4fc3\u8fdb[f\u0259's\u026al\u026ate\u026at]\nLiechtenstein|\u5217\u652f\u6566\u65af\u767b['l\u026akt\u0259nsta\u026an]\nmultinational|\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8[m\u028clt\u026a'n\u00e6\u0283(\u0259)n(\u0259)l]\ndeliberately|\u8c28\u614e\u5730[d\u026a'l\u026ab\u0259r\u0259tli]\nfranchisee|\u7279\u8bb8\u7ecf\u8425\u4eba[,fr\u00e6nt\u0283a\u026a'zi\u02d0]","cshortleadbody":"\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u5f00\u59cb\u6253\u51fb\u8de8\u56fd\u4f01\u4e1a\u907f\u7a0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u9645\uff0c\u6b27\u6d32\u8bae\u4f1a\u62a5\u544a\u6307\u51fa\uff0cIKEA\u8fc7\u53bb6\u5e74\u6765\u900f\u8fc7\u6bd4\u5229\u65f6\u4e0e\u5362\u68ee\u5821\u7b49\u56fd\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0e\u6f0f\u6d1e\u907f\u7a0e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5e97\u6743\u5229\u91d1\u8f6c\u8fdb\u8377\u5170\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u6d41\u5165\u6b27\u6d32\u4e2d\u90e8\u5c0f\u56fd\u5217\u652f\u6566\u65af\u767b\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u89c4\u907f\u7a0e\u6b3e\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u4ebf\u6b27\u5143\uff0c\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b9c\u5bb6\u662f\u5426\u5b9a\u7684\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhere did officials and campaigners pay attention to about US multinationals?

But it said in its last financial year it paid \u20ac822m of corporate tax at an effective rate of 19 per cent, plus \u20ac700m of other taxes such as property levies.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Ikea Group pays taxes in accordance with laws and regulations, wherever we are present as retailer, manufacturer or in any other role. We have a strong commitment to manage our operations in a responsible way and to contribute to the societies where we operate.\u201d\n\nMolly Scott Cato, the Green tax policy spokesperson said: \u201cIkea has deliberately created this multilayer company model to enable it to shift hundreds of millions of euros through several EU tax havens, with Liechtenstein the end destination for much of this, to make sure it remains untaxed.\u201d\n\nThe structure was set up by Ingvar Kamprad, the 89-year-old founder of Ikea, who split his company in two in the 1970s, placing each half under the ownership of a foundation to give Ikea \u201ceternal life\u201d. Ikea is split into the Ikea Group, which is the main franchisee, and Inter Ikea, which owns the rights.\n\nThe MEPs said that Ikea found new ways in recent years to shift profits and said proposals recently put forward by the commission to tackle tax avoidance would not fully address their concerns.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u8d22\u7ecf,\u91d1\u878d,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32,\u96f6\u552e,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u8d22\u7ecf,\u91d1\u878d","industry":"\u96f6\u552e","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1455465600","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/0\/000058670_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6166","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1455437070","cheadline":"\u5931\u5ba0\u7684\u85af\u7247 ","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"popcorn|\u7206\u7c73\u82b1['p\u0252pk\u0254\u02d0n]\ntransatlantic|\u8de8\u5927\u897f\u6d0b\u7684[,tr\u00e6nz\u0259t'l\u00e6nt\u026ak]\nobesity|\u80a5\u80d6[\u0259(\u028a)'bi\u02d0s\u026at\u026a]\nflavor|\u9999\u5473['fle\u026av\u0259]\nWalkers|\u6c83\u514b\u65af\uff08\u82f1\u56fd\u85af\u7247\u54c1\u724c\uff09","cshortleadbody":"\u85af\u7247\u4f5c\u4e3a\u82f1\u56fd\u4eba\u66fe\u7ecf\u6700\u7231\u7684\u96f6\u98df\uff0c\u53d7\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7ade\u4ef7\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u5360\u6709\u7387\u6b63\u5728\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u7206\u7c73\u82b1\u548c\u575a\u679c\u7b49\u96f6\u98df\u5219\u9010\u6e10\u663e\u9732\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhich factor makes crisps come under pressure?

Hand-cooked.\n\nBut with consumers increasingly health conscious, the crisp has come under pressure from rival snacks such as nuts and that transatlantic upstart, popcorn.\n\nSales in Britain of potato crisps fell to \u00a31.34bn in 2015 \u2014 the second consecutive year of decline \u2014 and were outsold for the first time by other snacks, according to a report on crisps, nuts and savoury snacks released on Wednesday by Mintel, the consumer research group.\n\nThe value of sales was also driven down by the country\u2019s increasingly desperate supermarket price wars, as retailers cut prices to compete with each other.\n\nAmy Price, senior analyst at Mintel, said: \u201cThe crisps market is experiencing deflation, with manufacturers and retailers turning to discounting to drive volumes as part of the supermarket price wars, and the category is losing out to healthier alternatives.\u201d\n\nCrisps producers are trying to boost sales by bringing out less unhealthy versions, though Mintel says the manufacturers have tended to lag behind other snacks in terms of new products.\n\nTwo-thirds of those who eat crisps and similar snacks said they would like them to be cooked in healthier cooking oils, such as olive or coconut. Almost half said they would like superfood vegetable crisps.\n\nHalf the crisps sold by value are Walkers \u2014 a brand owned by PepsiCo of the US. In recent years it has launched Walkers Pops and Walkers Baked, which contain half the fat, or less, of that in traditional fried crisps.\n\nPopcorn is the \u201cstar\u201d performer in the snacks markets, with sales almost trebling over the past five years, helped by a \u201cburst of innovation\u201d of flavours and types, according to Mintel.\n\nSales have risen 169 per cent against an 8 per cent rise in crisps over the same period. However, at \u00a3129m last year, popcorn sales are only a fraction of that of crisps.\n\nOther types of savoury snacks, including tortilla chips, have also grown strongly, 25 per cent over the past five years. In total, sales of these other snacks reached \u00a31.39bn last year, overtaking crisps for the first time.\n\nNuts have grown in popularity but they tend to be consumed by older adults, aged 45 and above. Mintel said manufacturers could tap the opportunity to get younger consumers interested.\n\n\u201cThe market needs to look to ways to engage younger consumers [and] educating young people about the energy benefits of nuts should resonate as 16-34 years olds are more likely than average to be influenced by products providing an energy boost when they shop,\u201d it said.\n\nAlthough sales have dropped over the past two years, it would be too soon to call \u201cpeak crisp\u201d, the research suggests, as the majority of consumers see them as a guilty pleasure.\n\n\u201cDespite the obesity crisis and swaths of the population trying to lose weight, adults have a rather relaxed attitude to crisps,\u201d said Ms Price. Four-fifths of people regard crisps as fine to eat as an \u201coccasional\u201d treat, while at least 60 per cent eat them regularly, at least once a week.\n\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd,\u96f6\u552e,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a","industry":"\u96f6\u552e","area":"\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd","scoop":"2","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1455379200","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/2\/000058642_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6158","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454742802","cheadline":"\u5251\u6865\u5927\u5b66\u65b0\u52a8\u4f5c","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"brightest pupils|\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u5b66\u751f\nlabyrinthine|\u8ff7\u5bab\u4e00\u6837\u7684[,l\u00e6b\u0259'r\u026an\u03b8a\u026an]\nopaque|\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684[\u0259(\u028a)'pe\u026ak]\ncapricious|\u53cd\u590d\u65e0\u5e38\u7684[k\u0259'pr\u026a\u0283\u0259s]\neligible|\u7b26\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u7684['el\u026ad\u0292\u026ab(\u0259)l]","cshortleadbody":"\u5251\u6865\u5927\u5b66\u51c6\u5907\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5165\u5b66\u7533\u8bf7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e4b\u524d\u4e3a\u4eba\u8bdf\u75c5\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhat is the failure of Britain\u2019s elite universities?

This week, David Cameron accused them of not doing enough to attract students from black and ethnic minority backgrounds and announced plans to force them to publish the ethnic background of students.\n\nThe Sutton Trust will say that teachers from state schools that traditionally send few students to Oxbridge are deterred from putting bright students forward because of the complexity of the system to outsiders.\n\nThere are 11 different exams at Oxford while Cambridge, until now, appeared at first glance to have as many as 380 although, in practice, many of them are simple tests rather than exams.\n\nThe opaque admissions system is traditionally believed to be subject to the capricious whims of university dons and was infamously captured in an incident in the late 1990s when Essex schoolgirl Tracy Playle was brought to tears, claiming that Eric Griffiths, her interviewer, had mocked her accent and background.\n\n\nUnder the new system, Cambridge\u2019s 29 undergraduate colleges will bring in a common written assessment to provide \u201cvaluable additional evidence\u201d of academic ability, subject knowledge and \u201cpotential to succeed\u201d following demands from teachers and students. The new system will be in place for those applying for entry in 2017.\n\nThe Sutton Trust will say in a report this week that the proportion of state school students at both universities has increased in recent years. Cambridge accepted 62 per cent of its students from state schools in 2014, while Oxford took 56 per cent, up from a combined average of 47 per cent in 1997. But there were just a total of 40 Oxbridge students in 2012 who were once eligible for free school meals, a widely used measure of poverty.\n\nSir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \u201cWe welcome anymeasure to simplify the admissions procedures at Oxbridge. However, Cambridge should be aware that tests could present a disadvantage for low and middle income students as there is a thriving market in private tuition for the extra admissions tests used at Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n\u201cWe will of course ensure that any changes that are made are fully reflected in our summer school programme, which now has 600 places at Cambridge.\u201d\n\nMr Cameron this week said it was unacceptable that young black men were more likely to be in prison than studying at a top university, that there were no black generals in the armed forces, and that only 4 per cent of FTSE chief executives were from ethnic minorities.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a","industry":"","area":"\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"007000061","pubdate":"1454688000","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/1\/000058571_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6150","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454663331","cheadline":"\u8116\u5b50\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u62cd\u7167\u76f8\u673a","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"pioneer|\u5148\u950b[pa\u026a\u0259\u2019n\u026a\u0259(r)]\ngadget|\u5c0f\u73a9\u610f[\u2019g\u00e6d\u0292\u026at]\npacemaker|\u9886\u8dd1\u8005['pe\u026asme\u026ak\u0259z]\ndoomed|\u96be\u9003\u4e00\u6b7b\u7684[d\u028amd]\nmeltdown|\u5f7b\u5e95\u57ae\u53f0[\u2019meltda\u028an]\nnarcissism|\u81ea\u604b[\u2019n\u0251:s\u026as\u026az\u0259m]\nnostalgic|\u6000\u65e7\u7684[n\u0252'st\u00e6ld\u0292\u026ak]\ngiggle|\u54af\u54af\u7684\u7b11['g\u026agl]\ngimmick|\u5671\u5934['g\u026am\u026ak]","cshortleadbody":"\u53f7\u79f0\u662f\u201c\u4e16\u754c\u9996\u6b3e\u667a\u80fd\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u76f8\u673a\u201d\u7684Autographer\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u53ef\u6302\u5728\u8116\u5b50\u4e0a\u6216\u8005\u522b\u5728\u8863\u670d\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u62cd\u7167\u76f8\u673a\u3002\u5b83\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c GPS\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u5149\u5f71\u3001\u8272\u5f69\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u62cd\u7167\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65f6\u671f\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u597d\u574f\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u786e\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u7279\u522b\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u52a8\u624b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhere did Autographer launched in the first place?

It was welcomed as a wearable-technology pioneer and was British \u2014 unusually for a novel consumer gadget.\n\nAutographer was worn like a necklace and took thousands of photos a day, prompted by sensors that intelligently detected movement and other stimuli in the hope of getting the occasional nice snap. Its slick launch at London Zoo was greeted with some excitement. Wearable technology, at least for those who don\u2019t count glasses and pacemakers as trendy enough to be called that, was with us.\n\nI\u2019m glad\/relieved that I reported Autographer as fun but doomed, because the \u00a3400 device was abandoned a few weeks ago by the maker. It was not a start-up, but the successful and perfectly grown-up Oxford Metrics Group, for whom it seems to have been a fairly small-scale experiment with a consumer product.\n\nApart from the fact that Autographer did not pass the common sense test, there were early signs of its ultimate demise. I saw the team at a wearable-tech show five months after launch and asked how it was going. Wonderfully, I was told, and proving particularly popular with magicians. Interesting market, but perhaps a little niche.\n\nThinking about Autographer\u2019s fate, I\u2019m not inclined to go into middle-aged meltdown about narcissism and modern youth\u2019s obsession with recording everything rather than living in the moment. It\u2019s wiser to take all that lightly; it\u2019s not the end of civilisation. But you still would have thought that was it for tiny wearable cameras.\n\nYet now a Swedish company, Narrative, which launched a smaller version called Clip at about the same time, is having another run at the idea. Clip simply took a photo every 30 seconds, but Clip 2 also captures video on demand, like a GoPro but a fraction of the size.\n\nAnd looking at Narrative\u2019s website, a tiny bit of me is thinking it looks, well, almost desirable. I take a lot of mobile phone videos, not for sharing, but to watch in idle moments for nostalgic purposes. So perhaps carrying a body camera, like some police officers now do, would be interesting? It would at least be handy for resolving domestic disputes: \u201cYou say you told me to get cat food at the supermarket. Let\u2019s check the recording.\u201d\n\nThe first Clip got more traction than our brave, British chaps managed. It was adopted by the very god of life-logging, Morris Villarroel, professor of animal behaviour at Madrid\u2019s Polytechnic University. Prof Villarroel has kept a microscopically detailed diary of his daily life since 2010, but has reportedly been using a Narrative camera to add 700,000-plus photos to his voluminous handwritten notes.\n\nWill Narrative bring wearable cameras to the mainstream? Probably not, but its tiny dimensions and less-clunky design than Autographer mean that convincing mainstream consumers is not as inconceivable.\n\nThe point is that there is a decent record of outlier innovations that seem bonkers when mooted, before then taking off \u2014 usually after another company has a stab at them. Leaving aside inventions such as writing (which Socrates thought disruptive and undesirable) and the telephone (which almost everyone thought was a gimmick), technologies such as texting and phone cameras have surprised even their inventors by how popular they have proved.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop giggling at the launch of the first camera phone I saw in 2001; whatever next? Colleagues reported the development more as quirky Japanese stuff, but essentially unwanted. I envisaged an epidemic of people taking and sending unrequested photos of their genitalia, which kind of happened but has been far from the defining characteristic of the behemoth that is phone photography.\n\nWhat, then, of the innovation greeted with the least enthusiasm in recent memory \u2014 the Google Glass internet spectacles, which within days spawned the expression \u201cGlassholes\u201d to describe their users? Privacy issues, creepiness issues and looking-stupid issues were among the problems.\n\nAccording to industry chat, it\u2019s just possible that Glass will be back in a less ridiculous form. Google supposedly has a team reviving the project under the name Aura. Now, an even smaller Narrative-type camera, embedded unobtrusively in a good-looking, socially acceptable connected spectacle frame, which recorded in high definition everything interesting you saw?\n\nThat could work for me.
