detained in China <\/b>\uff08378words\uff09\nBy Charles Clover in Beijing\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe man behind one of China\u2019s most catchy pop songs was detained by police on Monday after Youku Tudou, his employer and the country\u2019s largest internet video site, accused him of corruption.\n\nLu Fanxi, former president of peer-generated content at Youku Tudou, was famous for producing highly popular content including Little Apple, a much played but critically panned hit.\n\nDrawing comparisons with South Korean pop singer Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style, the song has grown into a viral internet meme and became the basis for recruiting video for the People\u2019s Liberation Army.\n\nMr Lu left Youku in July last year in unclear circumstances, months before the platform was taken over by Alibaba, the ecommerce group.\n\nAn internal letter sent to employees by Heyi Film, Youku\u2019s film studio, and published in the Chinese press, said the charges against Mr Lu arise from an audit of Youku finances that \u201cfound some points of serious suspicion in certain production projects\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom the information we have now, we know that former employee Lu Fanxi is suspected of exploiting his position to take illegal and criminal activities,\u201d the company said. \u201cLu has been taken away by the police to help with the investigation.\u201d\n\nA person with close ties to the online video industry said the charges arise out of suspicion Mr Lu had colluded with contracting companies for kickbacks, and the accusations are not related to any one show.\n\nMr Lu\u2019s case appeared to be similar to that of Liu Chunning, an executive at Alibaba in charge of video content who was detained by police in July after an internal probe by Tencent, his former employer. Both men were in video production, were fingered by internal audits and turned over to police.\n\nThe popularity of Little Apple by the duo Chopstick Brothers helped pave the way for more peer-generated content to catch on at China\u2019s online video sites. It was the theme song to Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon, a film released in May 2014 and one of the first full productions financed by Youku Tudou.\n\nLargely due to Mr Lu\u2019s marketing blitz, as well as a combination of repetitive melodies and simple lyrics, it was an immediate hit on the internet and helped popularise a dance form known as square dancing.\n\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd,\u79d1\u6280,\u5a92\u4f53,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u4eba\u7269,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406","industry":"\u79d1\u6280,\u5a92\u4f53","area":"\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1454342400","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/6\/000058406_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6117","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454316792","cheadline":"\u4e0d\u8981\u6025\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c37\u6b4c\u53d1\u6c14","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"spat|\u53e3\u89d2\uff0c\u6311\u8845[sp\u00e6t]\ntactics|\u7b56\u7565['t\u00e6kt\u026aks]\njurisdiction|\u53f8\u6cd5\u6743\uff0c\u5ba1\u5224\u6743jurisdiction\nmarginal|\u4e34\u754c\u7684['m\u0251\u02d0d\u0292\u026an(\u0259)l]\nhaughty|\u50b2\u6162\u7684['h\u0254\u02d0t\u026a]\nwholesale|\u6279\u53d1\u7684['h\u0259\u028alse\u026al]\noffshore|\u79bb\u5cb8\u7684['\u0252f\u0283\u0254\u02d0; \u0252f'\u0283\u0254\u02d0]\nprone|\u6709\u2026\u503e\u5411\u7684[pr\u0259\u028an]\nupheaval|\u5267\u53d8[\u028cp'hi\u02d0v(\u0259)l]\nexchequer|\u8d22\u6e90\uff0c\u56fd\u5e93[\u026aks't\u0283ek\u0259; eks]","cshortleadbody":"\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8c37\u6b4c\u8fd1\u671f\u9ebb\u70e6\u7f20\u8eab\u7684\u7a0e\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u89c2\u70b9\u79f0\u4e0d\u8981\u5148\u6025\u4e8e\u8fc1\u6012\u4e8e\u8fd9\u5bb6\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u591a\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u652f\u4ed8\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u7a0e\u52a1\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhat is the main reason made Google pay tax to US as Mr Schmidt said?

We cough up what we\u2019re required to by law, it says. You want more? Well, you\u2019re a democracy; pass some legislation.\n\nThe company\u2019s chairman Eric Schmidt made just this point three years ago during one of Google\u2019s periodic spats about the paltry sums it pays to Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue & Customs. \u201cI am rather puzzled by this debate which has been going on in the UK for some time because I view taxes as not optional,\u201d he said.\n\nGoogle wasn\u2019t going to pay tax voluntarily just to appease an aggrieved British public, Mr Schmidt observed. It would pay what its lawyers told it to, and not a penny more.\n\nBritish governments have tried tweaking the rules to curb the tactics Google and other US tech companies use to reduce their tax liabilities. For instance, the Diverted Profits Tax (or \u201cGoogle tax\u201d) was introduced to frustrate some of the tricks that annoy the public, notably the shifting of profits offshore through questionable inter-group charges to jurisdictions that attract lower rates of tax.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t worked. In spite of the new rules, Google still successfully maintains that all but a sliver of the value that goes to achieving its UK sales arises somewhere else. When the company recently settled with HMRC over its past and future liabilities, the Google tax apparently wasn\u2019t even invoked.\n\nAnd because reforming corporation tax is so difficult, requiring wholesale international agreement, that pretty much exhausts politicians\u2019 ammunition when it comes to legal combat. Their only recourse is to cut rates to make avoidance more marginal, while pleading with haughty multinationals for a few more crumbs from the groaning board.\n\nThere is, however, one simple measure that might allow the UK to do more than get mad at Google \u2014 and actually get even. It wouldn\u2019t require a wholesale revision of the existing system. It involves reviving (in a reformed guise) a levy abolished in 1999: Advance Corporation Tax (ACT).\n\nIntroduced in 1973 primarily to reform the taxation of dividends, this also addressed a similar problem: high rates of corporation tax had encouraged multinationals \u2014 perfectly legally \u2014 to shift profits overseas by shuffling activities overseas. It was paid at the rate of 30 per cent on dividends, and could only be offset against corporation tax. Shift too much profit offshore and you either had to cut your dividend or see your rate of tax go up.\n\nThe new Advance Corporation Sales Tax (ACST) would be based on a similar principle. Set at a percentage of a company\u2019s UK sales, the levy would be offset against its corporation tax payments. ACST could be set at varying levels for different sectors, based on their profitability, and targeted at those \u2014 such as web services and retail \u2014 that are prone to abuse.\n\nJust as with the original, the beauty would be that ordinary UK taxpaying companies would be unaffected. Only those that shunted profits abroad would be hit.\n\nTo see how it would work, take a company like Google, with \u00a34.3bn of UK sales in 2014. Apply ACST at the rate of, say, 4 per cent and it would have to pay \u00a3173m. Now if Google declared profits in Britain in line with its 26 per cent global margin, that would give it \u00a31.1bn on which it would pay corporation tax of roughly \u00a3220m \u2014 more than enough to offset the ACST it had already paid. But if it continued to do what it currently does, squirrelling away profits overseas and stumping up just \u00a330m of corporation tax, \u00a3143m of that ACST bill would be unrelieved.\n\nImportantly, the tax-take would be raised without undue upheaval. There would be nothing to stop Google, Amazon or Facebook continuing to arrange their affairs however they liked, so long as they paid the ACST. But the new tax would stop the crazy state of affairs whereby the exchequer in effect subsidises their R&D and pricing strategies \u2014 the very mechanisms by which they are pushing their onshore UK competitors steadily to the wall.\n\nThere would be wrinkles of course. A low-profit or lossmaking business would need to be able to recover the ACST against a legitimate UK profit and loss account. There would be legal challenges \u2014 although the system isn\u2019t obviously discriminatory and the old ACT regime was compatible with the Treaty of Rome.\n\nBut, anyway, that shouldn\u2019t deter politicians from exploring the remedy. Those who play by the rules deserve a level field to play on. Mr Schmidt is right: shaming cannot be the main basis for tax policy. If the UK wants to collect more, it should stop pleading and find a law that works.\n\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u8d22\u7ecf,\u79d1\u6280,\u91d1\u878d,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u8d22\u7ecf,\u79d1\u6280,\u91d1\u878d","industry":"","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd","scoop":"5","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1454256000","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/2\/000058392_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6109","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1454060099","cheadline":"\u5230\u5e95\u5403\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u7684\uff1f","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"expiate|\u8865\u507f['eksp\u026ae\u026at]\nsaturated|\u9971\u548c\u7684\uff0c\u6e17\u900f\u7684['s\u00e6t\u0283\u0259re\u026at\u026ad]\nepidemic|\u6d41\u884c\u7684[ep\u026a'dem\u026ak]\ndietary|\u996e\u98df\u7684['da\u026a\u0259t(\u0259)r\u026a]\nvillain|\u574f\u4eba['v\u026al\u0259n]\ncarcinogenic|\u81f4\u764c\u7684[,k\u0251\u02d0s(\u026a)n\u0259'd\u0292en\u026ak]\nendocrinology|\u5185\u5206\u6ccc\u5b66[,end\u0259\u028akr\u026a'n\u0252l\u0259d\u0292\u026a]\nbeverage|\u996e\u6599['bev(\u0259)r\u026ad\u0292]\nlubricated|\u6da6\u6ed1\u7684\uff0c\u559d\u9189\u7684['lu:brikeitid]","cshortleadbody":"\u8425\u517b\u5b66\u5bb6\u73b0\u5728\u8054\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u4e3a\u9971\u548c\u8102\u80aa\u6b63\u540d\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u66fe\u7ecf\u5f88\u957f\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u5728\u8425\u517b\u5b66\u5bb6\u9ed1\u540d\u5355\u4e0a\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u53c8\u628a\u77db\u5934\u6307\u5411\u4e86\u7cd6\u3002\u8102\u80aa\uff0c\u7cd6\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u52a0\u5de5\u8fc7\u7684\u8089\u7c7b\uff0c\u7a76\u7adf\u8c01\u624d\u662f\u6700\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u996e\u98df\uff1f","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div

really safe to eat? <\/b>\uff081000words\uff09\nBy Clive Cookson\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nFood health scares and dietary controversies continue to erupt in the news. Last year, for instance, the World Health Organisation\u2019s cancer agency told us that processed meat is a cancer hazard; in the UK, Public Health England and the House of Commons health committee threw their weight behind a sugar tax on sweet drinks to curb the obesity epidemic; and New York City forced fast food joints to put a sinister symbol of a saltshaker inside a black triangle beside high-salt items on their menus.\n\nThe news has not been all bad. Several studies now suggest that one of the worst dietary villains of the past few decades, saturated fat from dairy products and meat, may not harm the heart as much as we have been led to believe.\n\nTwo sweeping reviews of existing studies, using the \u201cmeta-analysis\u201d technique, found little or no benefit from cutting down on saturated fats.\n\nOne carried out by the Cochrane collaboration (an international organisation producing independent medical evidence) pulled together the results of 15 clinical trials in which a total of 59,000 participants were divided at random into groups consuming different amounts of saturated fat for a period of at least two years. Reducing fat had no effect on mortality, though it slightly cut the number of non-fatal heart attacks and strokes.\n\nThe other review, a meta-analysis by researchers at Canadian universities, focused on 73 \u201cobservational studies\u201d, which are larger and easier to carry out than clinical trials but regarded as less authoritative in scientific circles. It too concluded that people eating more saturated fat were no more likely to suffer heart disease, stroke or type-2 diabetes, or indeed to die prematurely of any cause.\n\nBut the world\u2019s biggest dietary health story of 2015 was the declaration in October by the International Agency for Research on Cancer that processed meat is carcinogenic while unprocessed cooked red meat is \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d. That unleashed a predictable storm of protest, with the North American Meat Institute calling the report \u201cdramatic and alarmist over-reach\u201d. In a memorable attack on the agency, Barry Carpenter, Nami president, said: \u201cOnly one substance, a chemical in yoga pants, has been declared by IARC not to cause cancer.\u201d\n\nThat left neutral scientists to put the report into context. \u201cThe WHO\u2019s decision means that there is sufficient evidence that processed meat consumption causes cancer,\u201d said Gunter Kuhnle, a food nutrition scientist at the University of Reading. \u201cIt does not mean, as purported by many stories in the media, that eating bacon is as bad as smoking. This is a dangerous oversimplification as processed meat can be part of a healthy lifestyle; smoking can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nKevin McConway, professor of applied statistics at the Open University, puts it like this: Of 100 people who never smoke, one will get lung cancer; of 100 smokers who get through a pack of cigarettes a day, more than 20 will get lung cancer. About 6 people in every 100 get bowel cancer; the figure rises to 7 in every 100 for those who eat two rashers of bacon a day over a lifetime.\n\nAfter meat, sugar was the top ingredient in the year\u2019s food health stories. The UK saw a succession of official reports calling for Britons to cut sugar intake by more than half for the sake of their health.\n\nThese said people should consume no more than 5 per cent of their daily calories as sugars. The previous official UK recommendation was 10 per cent, while actual sugar consumption is 12 per cent of an average adult\u2019s and 15 per cent of a teenager\u2019s calories.\n\nA study published last week in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology found that cutting the amount of sugar in fizzy drinks by 40 per cent over five years would prevent 1m adults becoming obese and 250,000 from developing diabetes.\n\nOne possible policy change, recommended by the British Medical Association and the Commons committee, is a tax on sugary drinks. Their sales have fallen by 12 per cent in Mexico where a 10 per cent tax was introduced two years ago, according to another study last week.\n\nIndustry bodies such as the Food and Drink Federation and the British Soft Drinks Association reject the swelling chorus of calls for such a levy, saying that sugar should not be \u201cdemonised\u201d among the many factors combining to cause obesity.\n\nSupport for strong action against excessive sugar in manufactured food and drink is almost universal among medical experts, though not everyone thinks a tax is the right route. Richard Tiffin, director of Reading University\u2019s Centre for Food Security, took part in a study suggesting that a 20 per cent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would reduce obesity rates by between 1 and 2 per cent. \u201cThis is a small benefit for a tax that hits poor people hardest and could lead people to making other unhealthy choices in their weekly shop instead,\u201d he says.\n\nBut Julian Hamilton-Shield, professor of diabetes and metabolic endocrinology at the University of Bristol, favours a tax. \u201cNo one can really doubt the harm sugar-containing drinks do to children: they rot their teeth and likely make them obese and at risk of later type-2 diabetes,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one complains about tobacco taxation: sugar should be treated the same way.\u201d\n\nBesides raising the price of undesirable ingredients, another weapon to promote healthy eating is labelling.\n\nThe latest example is in New York City, which already requires calorie labels in restaurant chains. Last month it mandated the addition of a salt warning to anything on the menu that contains more than a teaspoon (2.3g) of sodium chloride.\n\nSo what is nutritionists\u2019 current advice for confused consumers wanting to eat and drink more healthily? Few would dispute the prescription of a varied diet containing plenty of raw and cooked vegetables and fruit and some meat, fish and dairy products, lubricated with olive oil and washed down occasionally with a glass or two of wine or beer \u2014 but containing as little added sugar and salt as possible.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u533b\u7597,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a","industry":"\u533b\u7597","area":"","scoop":"4","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1453996800","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/7\/000058367_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6101","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1453973834","cheadline":"\u4e94\u6bd4\u96f6\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5b8c\u80dc\u4eba\u7c7b\uff1f","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"dub|\u6388\u4e88\u79f0\u53f7[d\u028cb]\nsubsidiary|\u5b50\u516c\u53f8[s\u0259b's\u026ad\u026a\u0259r\u026a]\ntriumph|\u83b7\u5f97\u80dc\u5229['tra\u026a\u028cmf]\nnil|\u65e0\uff0c\u96f6[n\u026al]\nintersection|\u4ea4\u53c9\u70b9[\u026ant\u0259'sek\u0283(\u0259)n]\ndeceptive|\u6b3a\u8bc8\u7684[d\u026a'sept\u026av]","cshortleadbody":"\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ade\u8d5b\u5728\u68cb\u7c7b\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e2d\u5df2\u4e0d\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u5b50\u68cb\u3001\u8df3\u68cb\u548c\u56fd\u9645\u8c61\u68cb\u7b49\u68cb\u7c7b\u4e0a\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u90fd\u5148\u540e\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f46\u5bf9\u62e5\u67092500\u591a\u5e74\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u56f4\u68cb\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\u4ece\u672a\u6218\u80dc\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002\u800c\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u8c37\u6b4c\u5ba3\u5e03\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\uff1a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ec8\u4e8e\u9996\u6b21\u5b8c\u80dc\u4eba\u7c7b\u6b27\u6d32\u51a0\u519b\uff01","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div

battle <\/b>\uff08530words\uff09\nBy Clive Cookson, Science Editor\n-----------------------------------------------------\nA computer has comprehensively beaten a human champion playing Go, the board game which has been dubbed the world\u2019s most complex \u2014 achieving \u201ca historic milestone in artificial intelligence\u201d according to Nature, the journal publishing the science behind the feat.\n\nThe AlphaGo machine, developed by Demis Hassabis and colleagues at Google\u2019s DeepMind subsidiary in London, triumphed over Fan Hui, the European Go champion, by five games to zero.\n\nJon Diamond, president of the British Go Association, said: \u201cBefore this match I was expecting it to be at least five to 10 years before a programme would be able to beat the top human players.\u201d\n\nOf course Google, a company at the forefront of the drive to transform business through AI, is not just playing for fun. \u201cWhile games are the perfect platform for developing and testing AI algorithms quickly and efficiently, ultimately we want to apply these techniques to important real-world problems,\u201d Mr Hassabis said.\n\nApplications will combine pattern recognition and forward planning. One early example will be an improved \u201cintelligent personal assistant\u201d for smartphones. Another application will be in medicine, combining images from scans and other patient data to diagnose disease and decide treatment.\n\nThe ancient game of Go, which originated in China more than 2,500 years ago, has an estimated 40m regular players worldwide and 1,000 professionals, mainly in east Asia.\n\nAlthough IBM\u2019s Deep Blue computer famously beat Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997, Go has a profound complexity far exceeding that of chess, said Mr Hassabis, who is a keen player of both games. \u201cThere are more positions in Go than the number of atoms in the universe,\u201d he added. \u201cGo has more subtlety and intellectual depth than chess.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s system defeated Fan Hui, a Chinese-born Frenchman who has played Go professionally since his teens, by five games to nil.\n\nGoogle has also beaten Facebook, whose chief executive Mark Zuckerberg posted on Wednesday that his team was close to \u201cbuilding an AI\u201d to win at Go.\n\n\u201cIn March AlphaGo will face its ultimate challenge, a five-game match in Seoul against the legendary Lee Sedol \u2014 the top Go player in the world over the past decade,\u201d Mr Hassabis said.\n\nIn a statement issued by Nature, Mr Lee said: \u201cI heard Google DeepMind\u2019s AI is surprisingly strong and getting stronger, but I am confident that I can win at least this time.\u201d If he is right, Google will pay him $1m; if he loses, the company gives $1m to charity.\n\nScientists have long used games as a testing ground for AI, to invent smart programmes that enable computers to tackle problems with something approaching human flexibility. But traditional AI methods, which search out options for all possible positions on the board, cannot work with Go.\n\nThe game looks simple. Starting with an empty square ruled with a grid of 19 by 19 lines, players alternately place white and black stones on the intersections between the lines; the aim is to control a larger area of the board than your opponent.\n\nBut the simplicity is deceptive; Go is the most complex \u201cgame of perfect knowledge\u201d \u2014 in which luck and hidden moves play no part \u2014 played regularly anywhere in the world.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u79d1\u6280,\u4f53\u80b2,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u79d1\u6280,\u4f53\u80b2","industry":"\u4e92\u8054\u7f51","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd","scoop":"4","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1453910400","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/0\/000058290_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6093","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1453886904","cheadline":"\u6b27\u6d32\u4e0d\u518d\u662f\u907f\u7a0e\u5929\u5802\uff1f","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"paltry|\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\u7684['p\u0254\u02d0ltr\u026a; 'p\u0252l-]\npermanent establishment|\u5e38\u8bbe\u673a\u6784\nparliamentary|\u8bae\u4f1a\u7684[,p\u0251\u02d0l\u0259'ment(\u0259)r\u026a]\nassertion|\u58f0\u660e[\u0259's\u025c\u02d0\u0283(\u0259)n]\nmultinational|\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8[m\u028clt\u026a'n\u00e6\u0283(\u0259)n(\u0259)l]\nbarrister|\u5927\u5f8b\u5e08['b\u00e6r\u026ast\u0259]\nduck|\u95ea\u907f\uff0c\u9e2d\u5b50[d\u028ck]","cshortleadbody":"\u5916\u56fd\u8de8\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u907f\u7a0e\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u76f4\u4e3a\u4eba\u6240\u8bdf\u75c5\uff0c\u4f46\u8c37\u6b4c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u81f3\u5c11\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u8d22\u5927\u6c14\u7c97\u7684\u8c37\u6b4c\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u653f\u6cbb\u98ce\u5411\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhere did the Google\u2019s sales of advertising space to UK clients take place?<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=rightanswer>\n\u5373\u4f7f\u8eab\u5904\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u82e5\u60f3\u5411\u8c37\u6b4c\u6295\u653e\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u4e5f\u5f97\u4e0e\u7231\u5c14\u5170\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u8054\u7edc\u3002 <\/div>\n<ul class=quizlist>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Irak <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> Bermuda <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=1> Ireland <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> London <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWho approved the OECD to solve the tax problem in November?<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=rightanswer>\n11\u6708\u7ecf\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8de8\u56fd\u5927\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7406\u7531\u590d\u6742\u4f46\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u8fbe\u5230\u907f\u7a0e\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u3002<\/div>\n<ul class=quizlist>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> HMRC  <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0>  American Government   <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=1> G20 leaders <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> WTO <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n\n\n\n<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nHow many UK-based staff were engaged in sales as Google said in 2013?

The central issue, though, is whether Google should be forced to concede that it has a taxable presence, or \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d, in Britain, making it liable to corporation tax on profits from its UK sales.\n\nUntil now, Google has avoided paying UK corporation tax because it argues that sales of advertising space to UK clients take place in Ireland. It classes its UK operation as a branch office, books the sales in Ireland and channels the profits to Bermuda.\n\nHM Revenue & Customs appears to be leaving this structure essentially intact, although the OECD has recommended changes to the definition of \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d, so that it would apply to operations that play \u201ca principal role\u201d in the negotiation of contracts, rather than simply to those that conclude contracts.\n\nThe OECD proposals, approved by G20 leaders in November, do not yet have legal force and the US, in particular, will not apply them. They are however an indication of the way policy is evolving at international level.\n\nAs far back as 2013, Google\u2019s assertion that none of its UK-based staff was engaged in sales earned it the derision of a parliamentary committee, which pointed to the sales targets and sales-related bonuses of employees dealing with the company\u2019s biggest UK clients. About 700 UK employees were working at the time in marketing and digital consultancy: many were recruited for their sales skills and were able to negotiate prices and agree sales, even when the final billing took place in Ireland.\n\nThe committee said HMRC had not done enough to challenge the \u201cmanifestly artificial\u201d tax arrangements of multinationals, noting that it had never tested an internet-based company on permanent establishment in the courts.\n\nJolyon Maugham, a tax barrister, says there are \u201ca lot of data points that would lead you to the conclusion that Google does operate a permanent establishment in the UK\u201d.\n\nOther countries, including France and Italy, have taken a much tougher approach to similar tax avoidance structures, with Paris reportedly seeking up to \u20ac1bn from Google even though its French business is much smaller than its London operation.\n\nHMRC appears to be ducking the fight. But if it gives up on Google, it will struggle to reach a better settlement with other fast-growing companies \u2014 Uber or Airbnb, for example \u2014 that are attracting the attention of tax authorities elsewhere.\n\nIf ministers hoped to defuse public anger over the apparent ease with which big multinationals can minimise their tax bills, they will have to think again.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u91d1\u878d,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd,\u79d1\u6280,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u91d1\u878d","industry":"\u79d1\u6280,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32,\u82f1\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1453824000","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/2\/000058272_piclink.jpg"}}],"photonews":[{"photonewsid":"955","publish_status":"publish","en_title":"tight_races_in_iowa_as_voters_flood_in","cn_title":"\u7f8e\u56fd\u603b\u7edf\u9009\u6218\u4e24\u515a\u6fc0\u70c8\u6253\u54cd","leadbody":"\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u70ed\u706b\u671d\u5929\u7684\u9009\u6218\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u603b\u7edf\u5927\u9009\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5c06\u5728\u5f53\u5730\u65f6\u95f42\u67081\u65e5\u665a\u95f47\u70b9\u62c9\u5f00\u9996\u6b21\u521d\u9009\u7684\u5e37\u5e55\u3002\u8fd9\u573a\u4e8e\u7f8e\u56fd\u7231\u8377\u534e\u5dde\uff08Iowa\uff09\u6700\u5148\u9e23\u67aa\u7684\u515a\u5185\u521d\u9009\uff0c\u5c06\u9009\u51fa\u53c2\u52a0\u5404\u515a\u7684\u515a\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\uff0c\u800c\u5404\u515a\u7684\u603b\u7edf\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u5219\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u3002\u56fe\u8f91\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u521d\u9009\u4e2d\u88ab\u6355\u6349\u7684\u82b1\u7d6e\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002","count_picture":"15","thumb_url":"photonews\/2016\/02\/56b0556ccdc306.76740294.jpg","add_times":"1454342400","tags":"\u9ad8\u6e05,\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u9009","adchannel":"","shortlead":"\u7f8e\u56fd\u5171\u548c\u515a\u603b\u7edf\u53c2\u9009\u4eba\u514b\u9c81\u5179\uff08Ted
