<\/b>\uff08480words\uff09\nBy Oliver Ralph\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe development of driverless and automated cars could shrink the size of the UK motor insurance market and force insurers to diversify, Standard & Poor\u2019s has warned.\n\nIn a report on the impact of automation, the rating agency said the trend would reduce the frequency and severity of claims, pushing down premiums.\n\n\u201cIt will be some time before these features become common, but when they do we expect a continuation in the trend of falling accidents,\u201d said Robert Greensted, analyst at S&P.\n\nThe total number of vehicle miles driven has remained static in the UK over the past 15 years, but the number of people killed or seriously injured has almost halved.\nAccording to KPMG estimates, by 2040 the personal automobile insurance sector could shrink to less than 40 per cent of its current size.\n\nThe arrival of completely driverless cars (without steering wheels or pedals) on the roads is still some way off \u2014 20 years, according to Thatcham, an automotive research centre \u2014 but in the shorter term, more basic levels of automation are already having an impact.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing some great benefits, especially in autonomous emergency braking, which leads to a reduction in accident frequency and a 40 per cent reduction in personal injury claims,\u201d said Peter Shaw, chief executive of Thatcham. \u201cWe are calling for regulation of autonomous braking \u2014 we\u2019d like to see it made a legal requirement.\u201d\n\nAlmost three-quarters of cars launched last year had autonomous emergency braking as either standard or an optional extra.\n\nWhile these developments have undoubted safety benefits, they create challenges for insurers. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to know, at the time a car has a collision, who is in charge. Was the vehicle self-driving, or was the owner driving? The vehicle status \u2014 who is doing the driving \u2014 needs to be available to all insurers,\u201d said Mr Shaw.\n\n\u201cOver the next 20 to 30 years we will see a shift from personal liability to product liability but perhaps not a complete shift,\u201d he added.\n\nThe insurance industry is readying itself for a response. The Association of British Insurers, along with Thatcham and 11 insurers including Admiral, Direct Line, LV= and the Lloyd\u2019s insurance market, has created a group to work with the government on the future of automated vehicle use.\n\nThe issues it will consider include liability after an accident, the use of data and potential changes to traffic laws. The group will be chaired by David Williams, head of underwriting at Axa.\n\nS&P believes that, faced with the impact of automation, motor insurers will have to diversify into other businesses, including home, pet or gadget insurance.\n\nBut it is possible they will look further afield. \u201cThey may also look to non-insurance products. A number of insurers already own price comparison sites. They might also look into consumer finance \u2014 a lot of them offer premium finance already,\u201d said S&P\u2019s Mr Greensted.\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u91d1\u878d,\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32,\u79d1\u6280,\u6c7d\u8f66,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u79d1\u6280,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u91d1\u878d","industry":"\u79d1\u6280,\u6c7d\u8f66","area":"\u5317\u7f8e\u6d32,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6b27\u6d32","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1453219200","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/6\/000058046_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6021","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1453195051","cheadline":"\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\uff1a\u653f\u5e9c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5185\u5bb9 YouTube\u7ec8\u83b7\u89e3\u7981","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"inflammatory|\u717d\u52a8\u6027\u7684[\u026an'fl\u00e6m\u0259t(\u0259)r\u026a]\nalongside|\u5728\u2026\u65c1\u8fb9[\u0259l\u0252\u014b'sa\u026ad]\ntelecom|\u7535\u4fe1['tel\u026ak\u0252m]\npagan|\u5f02\u6559\u5f92\u7684['pe\u026ag(\u0259)n]\ncensorship|\u5ba1\u67e5\u5236\u5ea6['sens\u0259\u0283\u026ap]\nblasphemous|\u4eb5\u6e0e\u795e\u660e\u7684['bl\u00e6sf\u0259m\u0259s]\nquell|\u5e73\u606f[kwel]","cshortleadbody":"\u5728\u7ec8\u6b62\u670d\u52a1\u4e09\u5e74\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f51\u7ad9YouTube\u5468\u4e00\u6b63\u5f0f\u91cd\u8fd4\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u5e02\u573a\u3002YouTube\u4e3a\u91cd\u8fd4\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u8be5\u56fd\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u7279\u6b8a\u7248\uff0c\u51c6\u8bb8\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u653f\u5e9c\u5bf9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5b58\u6709\u4eb5\u6e0e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nHow could YouTube get the permit from Pakistan?<\/div>\n<div>\n<div class=rightanswer>\n\u8c37\u6b4c\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u4e13\u7528\u7248YouTube\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5df4\u57fa\u65af\u5766\u5f53\u5c40\u5ba1\u67e5\u8be5\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002 <\/div>\n<ul class=quizlist>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=1> create a specific version <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> bribe local officials  <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> setup the upload limit  <\/li>\n<li onclick=\"quizcheck(this)\" value=0> real-name system <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/span>\n\n\n\n\n\n<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWho sparked violent protests after the \u201cinflammatory video\u201d in 2012?

The three-year ban has been one of the site\u2019s most high-profile outages, alongside its legal battles in Turkey.\n\nPakistan\u2019s government on Monday ordered the country\u2019s telecom regulator to lift a ban on YouTube within 48 hours, a senior Pakistani official told the Financial Times. \u201cWe have reached an understanding with YouTube so that material considered offensive will not be shown in Pakistan,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the agreement, the Pakistan Telecom Authority will be able to ask YouTube to remove any material it deems offensive, the government said in a statement.\n\nYouTube maintains more than 85 country-specific sites around the world in order to showcase local content, and in some cases to comply with local censorship laws.\n\nIn Google\u2019s most recent transparency report, the company said that YouTube received more than 12,000 takedown requests from governments during the second half of 2014. The company said it had complied with about half of these demands.\n\nWestern diplomats said the ban had become irrelevant as many users in Pakistan had found ways to access YouTube using proxy servers. \u201cMany users were able to successfully access YouTube so what was the point [of] keeping the ban,\u201d said one.\n\nYouTube and other US sites including Facebook have faced periodic blocks in Pakistan over content that is deemed to be blasphemous.\n\nThe film, which sparked the ban and caused riots across the Muslim world, was a crude piece of propaganda against the Prophet Mohammed. After the attacks, YouTube removed the video from its site in Egypt and in Libya, but it remained uploaded in other countries.\n\nProtests in Pakistan over the film grew so large that the US government ran advertisements on local television denouncing the film, hoping to quell the violence.\n\n\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u653f\u6cbb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u4e1c,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,\u5a92\u4f53,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u653f\u6cbb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406","industry":"\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,\u5a92\u4f53","area":"\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u4e1c","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1453132800","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/6\/000057996_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6013","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1453104577","cheadline":"\u767e\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7ba1\u88ab\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f51\u4fe1\u529e\u7ea6\u8c08","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"pornography|\u8272\u60c5[p\u0254\u02d0'n\u0252gr\u0259f\u026a]\ncensorship|\u5ba1\u67e5\u5236\u5ea6['sens\u0259\u0283\u026ap]\ntrinity|\u4e09\u5408\u4e00\uff0c\u4e09\u5de8\u5934['tr\u026an\u026at\u026a]\nto be listed|\u4e0a\u5e02\nunethical|\u7f3a\u4e4f\u804c\u4e1a\u9053\u5fb7\u7684[\u028cn'e\u03b8\u026ak(\u0259)l]\nbulletin|\u516c\u544a['b\u028al\u026at\u026an]\nhaemophilia|\u8840\u53cb\u75c5[,h\u025bmo'f\u026al\u026ar]\npharmaceutical|\u5236\u836f\u7684[,f\u0251\u02d0m\u0259'su\u02d0t\u026ak(\u0259)l]","cshortleadbody":"\u636e\u4e2d\u56fd\u5a92\u4f53\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u70ed\u95e8\u8d34\u5427\u7684\u5427\u4e3b\u6743\u53ef\u4ee5\u5356\u5230\u6bcf\u5e74100\u4e07\u5143\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\uff08\u540815.2\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u516c\u53f8\u8d1f\u8d23\u8054\u7cfb\u767e\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8425\u5229\u6027\u533b\u9662\u548c\u836f\u4f01\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u4f63\u91d1\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhat is the reason of Google\u2019s shut down in China?

However, disappointing half-year earnings in July suggest its star may be waning.\n\nThe latest scandal shows it is not too big to fend off criticism of unethical behaviour \u2014 or to evade the attentions of the regulator. The State Internet Information Office said it had grilled Baidu executives on Friday and that the company would face unspecified punishment.\n\nIn addition to several breaches, the regulator said: \u201cSome search results on Baidu are not impartial or objective, and its news channel has spread harmful information involving violence and terrorism.\u201d\n\nBaidu has apologised for seeking to financially exploit medical information bulletin boards and said it would stop the practice on its Tieba, or Post Bar, site.\n\nChinese netizens had attacked the company for replacing the volunteer moderator of its haemophilia-themed bulletin board with a private hospital that was accused of providing substandard care. The popular Tieba platform hosts about 19m forums devoted to a wide range of topics.\n\nBaidu previously faced accusations of altering search results to feature entities that paid it to have their sites highly ranked. The incident also comes amid widespread public distrust of doctors and hospitals over accusations of corruption and shoddy care.\n\n\u201cSixteen years ago, the two search engine companies [Google and Baidu] started at almost the same time. Sixteen years later, one company is researching the feasibility of quantum computing. By contrast, the other one is researching how to help other people sell fake medicine,\u201d Sina Weibo user 5718276383 said on the Twitter-like social media platform.\n\nBaidu said on Saturday it would partner with non-profit organisations to raise the quality of medical information on its Tieba site. In addition to problems on the haemophilia board, local media raised doubts about the qualifications of for-profit hospitals and pharmaceutical companies in charge of Tieba forums to dispense advice on high blood pressure, liver disease, vascular disease and uterine fibroids.\n\nLocal media reported that moderation rights to the most popular forums could fetch more than Rmb1m ($152,000) a year, with advertising agencies taking a commission for connecting Baidu with for-profit hospitals and pharmaceutical companies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard a broad range of criticism and advice from media and netizens, as well as the voices of Tieba users. This incident has exposed a dereliction of duty in the management of our Tieba commercialisation,\u201d Baidu said on in a statement on its official Weibo account.\n\nBaidu\u2019s apology failed to quell all the critics. A group of 36 non-profits has filed a complaint with the Beijing Administration of Industry and Commerce accusing Baidu of violating China\u2019s advertising law.\n\nA Baidu spokesman declined to comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Ma Nan\n","cbyline_description":"","cauthor":"","cbyline_status":"","ebyline_description":"","eauthor":"","ebyline_status":"","thumblink":"","tag":"\u901f\u8bfb,\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u653f\u6cbb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a,\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd,\u79d1\u6280,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,","genre":"0","topic":"\u65b0\u95fb,\u793e\u4f1a,\u653f\u6cbb,\u5546\u4e1a\u4e0e\u7ba1\u7406,\u7ba1\u7406,\u884c\u4e1a","industry":"\u79d1\u6280,\u4e92\u8054\u7f51","area":"\u4e9a\u6d32,\u4e2d\u56fd","scoop":"3","original":"defau","show_english":"no","column":"","pubdate":"1453046400","suppressad":null,"accessright":null,"adchannel":"","breadcrumb":null,"headlinesize":null,"customlink":"","last_publish_time":"0","templates":"interactive_speedread.html","story_pic":{"bigbutton":"http:\/\/i.ftimg.net\/\/picture\/0\/000057970_piclink.jpg"}},{"id":"6004","publish_status":"queue","fileupdatetime":"1452849360","cheadline":"\u5168\u7403\u6d77\u8fd0\u5e02\u573a\uff1a\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e2d\u56fd\u6765\u4e86","cskylineheadline":"","cskylinetext":"","clongleadbody":"logistics|\u7269\u6d41\uff0c\u540e\u52e4[l\u0259'd\u0292\u026ast\u026aks]\nvessel|\u8239\uff0c\u8840\u7ba1\uff0c\u5bb9\u5668['ves(\u0259)l]\nlarge-scale|\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\nfreight|\u8fd0\u9001[fre\u026at]\nforay|\u4fb5\u7565\uff0c\u88ad\u51fb['f\u0252re\u026a]","cshortleadbody":"\u4ece\u5546\u54c1\u96f6\u552e\u5230\u4e91\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u5361\u8f66\u3001\u98de\u673a\u8d27\u8fd0\u518d\u5230\u8f6e\u8239\u8fdc\u6d0b\u8fd0\u8f93\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5df2\u7ecf\u6321\u4e0d\u4f4f\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u6269\u5f20\u6b65\u4f10\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u4e2d\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u8fdc\u6d0b\u8d27\u7269\u8fd0\u8f93\u724c\u7167\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u5bb6\u6d77\u6d0b\u8d27\u7269\u8fd0\u8f93\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u6b64\u4e3e\u4e5f\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8fdb\u5165\u4e86\u4ef7\u503c3500\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6d77\u6d0b\u8fd0\u8f93\u5e02\u573a\u3002","cbyline":"0","cbody":"<span>\n<div class=pagetitle>\u9009\u62e9\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848<\/div>\n<div class=pageintro>\nWhere is Amazon\u2019s headquarters in US?

Last year it purchased its first fleet of Amazon-branded truck trailers to help ferry goods between warehouses. The company also started running a pilot programme for air cargo operations out of Wilmington, Ohio, according to analysts.\n\nBig retail companies in the US such as Walmart typically buy space directly from shipping lines, making Amazon the only major US retailer that has taken the unusual step of getting its own licence.\n\nAmazon\u2019s ocean shipping volume is less than a tenth of Walmart\u2019s, according to people familiar with the matter. Walmart ships only goods that it has already purchased in China, whereas Amazon\u2019s licence will allow it to sell shipping space to third parties if it wishes, as well as shipping its own goods.\n\nThe licence, held by Amazon China, allows it to buy space from vessel owners and sell it to the public. It was registered with US authorities in November, and went unnoticed until it was spotted in an online database on Thursday by Flexport.\n\nHowever, analysts questioned whether Amazon would use the licence to provide shipping services for third parties. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen their forays into transportation as being a business they want to provide for others, as much as a way to secure capacity for their own network,\u201d said Peter Tirschwell, senior director at IHS Maritime, citing Amazon\u2019s trucking and air cargo programmes as examples.\n\nHe added that selling shipping space was \u201cnot a growth business, and not a profitable business\u201d.\n\nA spokeswoman for the US Federal Maritime Commission said Amazon China\u2019s registration papers were submitted on November 9.
