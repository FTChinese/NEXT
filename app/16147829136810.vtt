00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:06.120 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, a
year ago in my first budget

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.717 align:middle line:84%
I announced our initial
response to coronavirus.

00:00:10.717 --> 00:00:13.050 align:middle line:84%
What was originally thought
to be a temporary disruption

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.310 align:middle line:84%
to our way of life has
fundamentally altered it.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.970 align:middle line:84%
People are still being told
to stay in their homes.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:84%
Businesses have been
ordered to close.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of people
are in hospital.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.340 align:middle line:90%
Much has changed.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:84%
But one thing has
stayed the same.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:84%
I said I would do
whatever it takes.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.827 align:middle line:90%
I have done, and I will do so.

00:00:41.827 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
We have announced over Â£280bn
of support, protecting jobs,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.810 align:middle line:84%
keeping businesses afloat,
helping families get by.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.360 align:middle line:84%
Despite this
unprecedented response,

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.780 align:middle line:84%
the damage coronavirus has done
to our economy has been acute.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.930 align:middle line:84%
Since March, over 700,000
people have lost their jobs.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Our economy has shrunk by
10 per cent, the largest

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:90%
fall in over 300 years.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Our borrowing is the highest
it has been outside of wartime.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take this
country and the whole world

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
a long time to recover from
this extraordinary economic

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.610 align:middle line:90%
situation.

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:90%
But we will recover.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.050 align:middle line:84%
This Budget meets the moment
with a three-part plan

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.780 align:middle line:84%
to protect the jobs
and livelihoods

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
of the British people.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
First, we will
continue doing whatever

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
it takes to support the
British people and businesses

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.050 align:middle line:90%
through this moment of crisis.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.060 align:middle line:84%
Second, once we are
on the way to recovery

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.690 align:middle line:84%
we will need to begin
fixing the public finances.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I want to be honest today
about our plans to do that.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And third, in today's
Budget we begin the work

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150 align:middle line:90%
of building our future economy.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.330 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
today's forecasts

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.380 align:middle line:84%
show that our response to
coronavirus is working.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.110 align:middle line:84%
The prime minister
last week, set

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.260 align:middle line:84%
out our cautious, but
irreversible roadmap

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.240 align:middle line:84%
to ease restrictions, whilst
protecting the British people.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
The NHS, deserving
of immense praise,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.780 align:middle line:84%
has had extraordinary
success in vaccinating

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
more than 20m people
across the United Kingdom.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And combined with our
economic response,

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.180 align:middle line:84%
one of the most comprehensive
and generous in the world,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
this means the Office
for Budget Responsibility

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
are now forecasting in their
words, "a swifter and more

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.520 align:middle line:84%
sustained recovery" than
they expected in November.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The OBR now expect
the economy to return

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
to its pre-Covid level by
the middle of next year,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
six months earlier than
previously thought.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
That means growth is faster,
unemployment lower, wages

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.190 align:middle line:84%
higher, investment higher,
household incomes higher.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
But while our prospects
are now stronger,

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.260 align:middle line:84%
coronavirus has done, and is
still doing profound damage.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And today's forecast made clear,
repairing the long-term damage

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.150 align:middle line:90%
will take time.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.910 align:middle line:84%
The OBR still expect
that in five years' time,

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.200 align:middle line:84%
because of coronavirus, our
economy will be 3 per cent

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200 align:middle line:90%
smaller than it would have been.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Before I share the detail
of the OBR's forecast,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
let me thank Richard Hughes
and his team for their work.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.140 align:middle line:84%
The OBR forecast that our
economy will grow this year

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
by 4 per cent, by 7.3 per cent
in 2022, then 1.7 per cent,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.260 align:middle line:84%
1.6 per cent, and 1.7 per
cent in the last three years

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.570 align:middle line:90%
of the forecast.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And the OBR have said that our
interventions to support jobs

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.410 align:middle line:90%
have worked.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
In July last year they
expected unemployment to peak

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.790 align:middle line:90%
at 11.9 per cent.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Today, because of
our interventions,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.625 align:middle line:84%
they forecast a much lower
peak, 6 and a half per cent.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That means 1.8m fewer people are
expected to be out of work than

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:90%
previously thought.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But every job lost
is a tragedy, which

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:84%
is why protecting, creating,
and supporting jobs

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.140 align:middle line:90%
remains my highest priority.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So, Madam deputy speaker,
let me turn straight away

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to the first part of
this Budget's plan

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
to protect the jobs
and livelihoods

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
of the British people
through the remaining

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:90%
phase of this crisis.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
First, the furlough
scheme will be extended

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.920 align:middle line:90%
until the end of September.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.460 align:middle line:84%
For employees there will
be no change to the terms.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.880 align:middle line:84%
They will continue to receive
80 per cent of their salary

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
for hours not worked
until the scheme ends.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
As businesses reopen
we will ask them

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.540 align:middle line:84%
to contribute,
alongside the taxpayer

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to the cost of paying
their employees.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Nothing will change until July,
when we will ask for a small

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
contribution of
just 10 per cent ,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and 20 per cent in
August and September.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:84%
The government is proud
of the furlough, one

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:84%
of the most generous
schemes in the world

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.650 align:middle line:84%
effectively protecting millions
of people's jobs and incomes.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Second, support for
the self-employed

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.950 align:middle line:84%
will also continue
until September,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:84%
with a fourth grant covering
the period February to April,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and a fifth and final
grant from May onwards.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.630 align:middle line:84%
The fourth grant will provide
three months of support

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
at 80 per cent of
average trading profits.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.000 align:middle line:84%
For the fifth grant,
people will continue

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.690 align:middle line:84%
to receive grants worth three
months of average profits

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
with the system open for
claims from late July.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.980 align:middle line:84%
But as the economy
reopens over the summer

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
it is fair to target our support
towards those most affected

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:90%
by the pandemic.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So people whose turnover has
fallen by 30 per cent or more

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.420 align:middle line:84%
will continue to receive
the full 80 per cent grant.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:84%
People whose turnover has
fallen by less than 30 per cent

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:84%
will therefore have less
need of taxpayer support

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.010 align:middle line:84%
and will receive a
30 per cent grant.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And I can also announce a
major improvement in access

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.160 align:middle line:90%
to the self-employed scheme.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
When the scheme was launched
a newly self-employed

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
couldn't qualify
because they hadn't all

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:90%
filed the 19-20 tax return.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.440 align:middle line:84%
But as the tax return
deadline has now

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
passed I can announce today
that provided they filed a tax

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.590 align:middle line:84%
return by midnight last
night, over 600,000 more

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
people, many of whom became
self-employed last year,

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.310 align:middle line:84%
can now claim the
fourth and fifth grants.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Over the course of this crisis
we will have spent Â£33bn

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.100 align:middle line:84%
supporting the self-employed,
one of the most generous

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.990 align:middle line:84%
programmes for self-employed
people anywhere in the world.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Third, we're also
extending our support

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.410 align:middle line:84%
for the lowest paid
and most vulnerable.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.370 align:middle line:84%
To support low income households
the universal credit uplift

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.740 align:middle line:84%
of Â£20 a week will continue
for a further six months,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.760 align:middle line:84%
well beyond the end of
this national lockdown.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.130 align:middle line:84%
We'll provide working
tax credit claimants

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.370 align:middle line:84%
with equivalent support
for the next six months.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And because of the way that
system works operationally,

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
we will need to do so with
a one-off payment of Â£500.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.669 align:middle line:84%
And over the course of
this year as the economy

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
begins to recover we are
shifting our resources

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and focus towards getting people
into decent, well-paid jobs.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
We reaffirm our
commitment to end low pay,

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:58.090 align:middle line:84%
increasing the national living
wage to Â£8.91 from April,

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:03.160 align:middle line:84%
an annual pay rise of almost
Â£350 for someone working full

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
time on the national
living wage.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And my right honourable
friends, the education secretary

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and the work and pensions
secretary are taking action

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.020 align:middle line:84%
to give people the skills they
need to get jobs or get better

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.010 align:middle line:90%
jobs.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.580 align:middle line:84%
The Restart Programme,
supporting over a million

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:90%
long-term unemployed people.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.170 align:middle line:84%
The number of work
coaches doubled.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The Kickstart scheme
funding high-quality jobs

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.350 align:middle line:84%
for over a quarter of
a million young people.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
The prime minister's
lifetime skills

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.450 align:middle line:84%
guarantee, giving every
adult the opportunity

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
for a fully-funded level
three qualification.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And we want businesses to
hire new apprentices so we're

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.140 align:middle line:90%
paying them more to do it.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, I am doubling the
incentive payments we give

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.770 align:middle line:90%
businesses to Â£3,000.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.420 align:middle line:84%
That's for all new
apprentice hires of any age,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:04.390 align:middle line:84%
alongside investing Â£126m of
new money to triple the number

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:90%
of traineeships.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.300 align:middle line:84%
We're taking what works
to get people into jobs

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:90%
and making it better.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.065 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.

00:10:12.065 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, one of
the hidden tragedies of lockdown

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
has been the increase
in domestic abuse.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:26.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm announcing today an extra
Â£19m on top of the Â£125m we

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
announced at the spending
review for domestic violence

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:33.530 align:middle line:84%
programmes to reduce the risk
of reoffending and to pilot

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:84%
a network of respite rooms
to provide specialist support

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.490 align:middle line:90%
for vulnerable homeless women.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
To recognise the sacrifices
made by so many women and men

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:84%
in the armed forces community,
I'm providing an additional

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Â£10m to support veterans
with mental health needs.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And on current
plans, the funding

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.770 align:middle line:84%
to support survivors of
the Thalidomide scandal

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:90%
runs out in 2023.

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
They deserve better than to
have constant uncertainty

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
about the future
costs of their care.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So not only will I extend this
funding with an initial down

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
payment of around Â£40m, I am
today announcing a lifetime

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.980 align:middle line:84%
commitment, guaranteeing
funding forever.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
And let me thank the Thalidomide
Trust and the honourable member

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.270 align:middle line:84%
for North Dorset for their
leadership on this important

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.400 align:middle line:90%
issue.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:84%
As well as supporting people's
jobs, incomes, the lowest

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:36.740 align:middle line:84%
paid, and most vulnerable,
this Budget also

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:90%
protects businesses.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
We've been providing businesses
with direct cash grants

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.140 align:middle line:90%
through the recent restrictions.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.490 align:middle line:84%
These grants come
to an end in March.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
I can announce today that we
will provide a new Restart

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Grant in April to
help businesses

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:57.650 align:middle line:90%
reopen and get going again.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Non-essential retail
businesses will open first.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So they will receive grants
of up to Â£6,000 per premises.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Hospitality and
leisure businesses,

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.970 align:middle line:84%
including personal
care and gyms will

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.410 align:middle line:84%
open later, or be more impacted
by restrictions when they do.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:20.090 align:middle line:84%
So we'll give them
grants of up to Â£18,000.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:26.210 align:middle line:84%
That's Â£5bn of new grants, on
top of the Â£20bn we've already

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.980 align:middle line:84%
provided, taking our direct
total cash support to business

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.010 align:middle line:90%
to Â£25bn.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And I pay tribute to my
right honourable friend,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
the member for Romsey
and Southampton North

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
for highlighting the particular
needs of the personal care

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
sector.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And with my right honourable
friend the culture secretary,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.410 align:middle line:84%
we're making available Â£700m
to support our incredible arts,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:84%
culture, and sporting
institutions as they re-open.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.590 align:middle line:84%
Backing the UK and Ireland's
joint 2030 World Cup bid,

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
launching a new approach to
apprenticeships in the creative

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.350 align:middle line:84%
industries, and extending our
Â£500m film and TV production

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.900 align:middle line:90%
Restart Scheme.

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Even with the new
restart grants,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.170 align:middle line:84%
some businesses will also need
loans to see them through.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.260 align:middle line:84%
As the Bounce Back Loan
and CBILS programmes come

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to an end, we're introducing
a new recovery loan scheme

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.860 align:middle line:90%
to take their place.

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Businesses of any size can
apply for loans from Â£25,000 up

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
to Â£10m through to
the end of this year.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
And the government will
provide a guarantee

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.465 align:middle line:90%
to lenders of 80 per cent.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Last year, we provided an
unprecedented 100 per cent

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.280 align:middle line:84%
business rates holiday in
England for all eligible

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
businesses in the
retail, hospitality,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:84%
and leisure sectors,
a tax cut worth Â£10bn.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:05.090 align:middle line:84%
This year, we'll continue with
the 100 per cent business rates

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.220 align:middle line:84%
holiday for the
first three months

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.840 align:middle line:84%
of the year, in other words,
through to the end of June.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.360 align:middle line:84%
For the remaining nine
months of the year,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
business rates will still
be discounted by two-thirds,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.010 align:middle line:84%
up to a value of Â£2m
for closed businesses,

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:84%
with a lower cap for those who
have been able to stay open,

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:90%
a Â£5bn tax cut for business.

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.050 align:middle line:84%
One of the hardest
hit sectors has

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.810 align:middle line:90%
been hospitality and tourism.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
150,000 businesses that
employ over 2.4m people need

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.150 align:middle line:90%
our support.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
To protect those
jobs, I can confirm

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
that the 5 per cent
reduced rate of VAT

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
will be extended for six months
to the 30th of September.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.305 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.

00:14:57.305 --> 00:15:00.710 align:middle line:84%
And even then, we
won't go straight back

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:90%
to the 20 per cent rate.

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
We'll have an interim rate
of 12 and half per cent

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:84%
for another six months, not
returning to the standard rate

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.400 align:middle line:90%
until April of next year.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
In total, we're cutting back
next year by almost Â£5bn.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
the housing sector

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.970 align:middle line:84%
supports over half
a million jobs.

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:84%
The cut in stamp
duty I announced

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
last summer has helped
hundreds of thousands of people

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
buy a home and supported the
economy at a critical time.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But due to the sheer
volume of transactions

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.080 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing many new
purchases won't complete

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.810 align:middle line:90%
in time for the end of March.

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So I can announce today the
Â£500,000 nil-rate band will not

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:90%
end on the 31st of March.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
It will end on the 30th of June.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Then, to smooth the
transition back to normal,

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.930 align:middle line:84%
the nil-rate band
will be Â£250,000,

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.070 align:middle line:84%
double its standard level
until the end of September.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.960 align:middle line:84%
And we will only return to the
usual level of Â£125,000 from

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:90%
October the 1st.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Even with the stamp
duty cut there is still

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
a significant barrier to
people getting on the housing

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:90%
ladder, the cost of a deposit.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'm announcing
today a new policy

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:84%
to stand behind home buyers,
a mortgage guarantee.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Lenders who provide mortgages
to home buyers who can only

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.160 align:middle line:84%
afford a 5 per cent deposit
will benefit from a government

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.950 align:middle line:90%
guarantee on those mortgages.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm pleased to say that
several of the country's

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.880 align:middle line:84%
largest lenders, including
Lloyds, NatWest, Santander,

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Barclays, and HSBC will be
offering these 95 per cent

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:90%
mortgages from next month.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And I know more,
including Virgin Money

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:90%
will follow shortly after.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:04.240 align:middle line:84%
A policy that gives people
who can't afford a big deposit

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:84%
the chance to buy
their own home.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.650 align:middle line:84%
As the prime
minister has said, we

00:17:08.650 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:84%
want to turn generation
rent into generation buy.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:19.780 align:middle line:84%
So Madam deeputy speaker, the
furlough extended to September.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Self-employed grants
extended to September.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Universal credit uplift
extended to September.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:84%
More money to tackle
domestic violence, bigger

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:34.510 align:middle line:84%
incentives to hire apprentices,
higher grants to struggling

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
businesses, extra funds for
culture, arts, and sport,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:84%
new loan schemes to
finance businesses,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:44.800 align:middle line:84%
kick-start start, restart,
a lifetime skills guarantee,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.540 align:middle line:90%
business rate, cut.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.100 align:middle line:90%
VAT, cut.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.630 align:middle line:90%
Stamp duty, cut.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And a new mortgage guarantee,
the first part of a Budget

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:84%
that protects the
jobs and livelihoods

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:57.380 align:middle line:90%
of the British people.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.477 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear.

00:17:59.477 --> 00:18:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And, Madam deputy
speaker, as you can see,

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.970 align:middle line:84%
we're going long,
extending our support

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:10.210 align:middle line:84%
well beyond the
end of the road map

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.990 align:middle line:84%
to accommodate even the most
cautious view about the time it

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
might take to exit
the restrictions.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.070 align:middle line:84%
Let me summarise for
the House the scale

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
of our total fiscal
response to coronavirus.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
At this Budget, we are
announcing an additional Â£65bn

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.930 align:middle line:84%
of measures over this year and
next to support the economy

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.510 align:middle line:90%
in response to coronavirus.

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Taking into account the
significant support announced

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.200 align:middle line:84%
at the spending review, this
means our total Covid support

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.572 align:middle line:84%
package this year
and next is Â£352bn.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And once you include the
measures announced at spring

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.940 align:middle line:84%
budget last year, including
the step change in capital

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:03.310 align:middle line:84%
investment, total fiscal support
from this government over this

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.926 align:middle line:90%
year and next amounts to Â£407bn.

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Coronavirus has caused
one of the largest,

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:84%
most comprehensive, and
sustained economic shocks

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:90%
this country has ever faced.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And by any objective
analysis, this government

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.120 align:middle line:84%
has delivered one of the
largest, most comprehensive,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and sustained responses
this country has ever seen.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So madam deputy speaker,
we're using the full measure

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.430 align:middle line:84%
of our fiscal
firepower to protect

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.720 align:middle line:84%
the jobs and livelihoods
of the British people.

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
But the damage done
by coronavirus,

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:84%
combined with a level of support
unimaginable only 12 months ago

00:19:54.550 --> 00:20:00.130 align:middle line:84%
has created huge challenges
for our public finances.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
The OBR's fiscal forecast
show that this year,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.380 align:middle line:84%
we have borrowed a
record amount, Â£355bn.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:16.470 align:middle line:84%
That's 17 per cent of our
national income, the highest

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
level of borrowing
since world war two.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Next year, as we continue our
unprecedented response to this

00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:84%
crisis, borrowing is
forecast to be Â£234bn,

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
10.4 per cent of GDP, an amount
so large it has only one rival

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:90%
in recent history, this year.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Without corrective
action, borrowing

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.370 align:middle line:84%
would continue at
very high levels,

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:49.020 align:middle line:84%
leaving underlying debt
rising indefinitely.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Instead, because of the
steps I am taking today,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:00.510 align:middle line:84%
borrowing falls to 4 and and a
half per cent of GDP in 2223,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:84%
3.5 per cent in 2324,
then 2.9 per cent

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and 2.8 per cent in the
following two years.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And while underlying debt
rises from 88.8 per cent of GDP

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.990 align:middle line:84%
this year to 93.8
per cent next year,

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:24.960 align:middle line:84%
it then peaks at 97.1
per cent in 2324,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
before stabilising and falling
slightly to 97 per cent

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and 96.8 per cent in the final
two years of the forecast.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Let me explain why this matters.

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
The amount we borrowed
is comparable only

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.580 align:middle line:84%
with the amount we borrowed
during the two world wars.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.370 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be the
work of many governments

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
over many decades
to pay it back.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Just as it would be
irresponsible to withdraw

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.320 align:middle line:84%
support too soon,
it would also be

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.380 align:middle line:84%
irresponsible to allow our
future borrowing and debt

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:90%
to rise unchecked.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:12.240 align:middle line:84%
When crises come, we
need to be able to act.

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And we need the fiscal
freedom to act, a freedom

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.560 align:middle line:84%
that you only have if you
start with public finances

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.730 align:middle line:90%
in a good and strong place.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The only reason we have been
able to respond as boldly as we

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.130 align:middle line:84%
have to Covid is
because 10 years

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:84%
of Conservative
governments painstakingly

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.380 align:middle line:90%
rebuilt our fiscal resilience.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely true.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
When the next crisis comes, we
need to be able to act again.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And while our borrowing costs
are affordable right now,

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:51.030 align:middle line:84%
interest rates and inflation
may not stay low forever.

00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:55.470 align:middle line:84%
And just a 1 percentage point
increase in both would now cost

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:59.100 align:middle line:90%
us over Â£25bn.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And as we have
seen in the markets

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
over the last few weeks,
sovereign bond yields

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.280 align:middle line:90%
can rise sharply.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:84%
This Budget is not the time
to set detailed fiscal rules

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.290 align:middle line:84%
with precise targets and
dates to achieve them by.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:19.440 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
would be sensible.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to be
honest about what

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.470 align:middle line:84%
I mean by sustainable
public finances

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.050 align:middle line:90%
and how I plan to achieve them.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Our fiscal decisions are
guided by three principles.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:39.690 align:middle line:84%
First, while it is right to
help people and businesses

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:44.550 align:middle line:84%
through an acute crisis like
this one, in normal times,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:84%
the state should
not be borrowing

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:84%
to pay for every-day
public spending.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Second, over the medium term,
we cannot allow our debt to keep

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:57.090 align:middle line:90%
rising.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And given how high
our debt now is,

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
we need to pay close attention
to its affordability.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And third, it is sensible
to take advantage

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.580 align:middle line:84%
of lower interest rates to
invest in capital projects that

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:90%
can drive our future growth.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
how we achieve that.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
How we balance the
extraordinary support

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.770 align:middle line:84%
we are providing to
the economy right now

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:84%
with the need to begin the work
of fixing our public finances.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:31.590 align:middle line:84%
I have, and always will
be honest with the country

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:90%
about the challenges we face.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:39.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'm announcing today two
measures to begin that work.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Let me take each in turn.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, our
response to coronavirus

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.760 align:middle line:84%
has been fair, with the poorest
households benefiting the most

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.100 align:middle line:90%
from our interventions.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And our approach to fixing the
public finances will be fair

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.070 align:middle line:84%
too, asking more of those people
and businesses who can afford

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:09.570 align:middle line:84%
to contribute and
protecting those who cannot.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.940 align:middle line:84%
So this government
is not going to raise

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
the rates of income tax,
national insurance, or VAT.

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Instead, our first step is to
freeze personal tax thresholds.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We've nearly doubled the
income tax personal allowance

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.760 align:middle line:84%
over the last decade,
making it the most generous

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:90%
of any G20 country.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:37.540 align:middle line:84%
We will of course, deliver our
promise to increase it again

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:90%
next year to Â£12,570.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
But we will then keep it
at this more generous level

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.800 align:middle line:90%
until April 2026.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.550 align:middle line:84%
The higher rate threshold will
similarly be increased next

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:55.600 align:middle line:90%
year to Â£50,270.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And will then also remain at
that level for the same period.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Nobody's take-home pay
will be less than it is now

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:07.880 align:middle line:90%
as a result of this policy.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.660 align:middle line:84%
But I want to be
clear with all members

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:15.040 align:middle line:84%
that this policy does remove
the incremental benefit created

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:84%
had thresholds continued
to increase with inflation.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.560 align:middle line:90%
We are not hiding it.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I am here explaining
it to the House.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And it is in the Budget
document in black and white.

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.410 align:middle line:90%
It is a tax policy.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.275 align:middle line:90%
It is progressive and fair.

00:26:32.275 --> 00:26:33.700 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.790 align:middle line:84%
And I will also maintain at
their current levels until

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:40.570 align:middle line:84%
April 2026, the
inheritance tax thresholds,

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:84%
the pensions lifetime allowance,
the annual exempt amount

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:48.130 align:middle line:84%
and capital gains tax, and
for two years from April 2022,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.770 align:middle line:84%
the VAT registration
threshold, which,

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:84%
at Â£85,000 will remain more
than twice as generous as the EU

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:90%
and OECD averages.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:02.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll also tackle fraud in our
Covid schemes with Â£100m to set

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:07.150 align:middle line:84%
up a new HMRC task force of
around 1,000 investigators,

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.290 align:middle line:84%
as well as new measures and
new investment in HMRC to clamp

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.570 align:middle line:84%
down on tax avoidance
and evasion.

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.470 align:middle line:84%
The full details are
set out in the red book.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, the
government is providing

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.590 align:middle line:84%
businesses with over Â£100bn
of support to get through this

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.100 align:middle line:90%
pandemic.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So it is fair and
necessary to ask them

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.020 align:middle line:90%
to contribute to our recovery.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
So the second step
I am taking today

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.780 align:middle line:84%
is that in 2023, the rate
of corporation tax paid

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.120 align:middle line:84%
on company profits will
increase to 25 per cent.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Even after this change,
the United Kingdom

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.960 align:middle line:84%
will still have the
lowest corporation tax

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:84%
rate in the G7, lower
than the United States,

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Canada, Italy, Japan,
Germany, and France.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:10.120 align:middle line:84%
We're also introducing
some crucial protections.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.840 align:middle line:84%
First, this new higher
rate won't take effect

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.120 align:middle line:84%
until April 2023, well after
the point when the OBR expect

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.910 align:middle line:90%
the economy to have recovered.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And even then, because
corporation tax is only

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.080 align:middle line:84%
charged on company profits,
any struggling business

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.770 align:middle line:84%
will by definition,
be unaffected.

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Second, I'm protecting small
businesses with profits

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.370 align:middle line:84%
of Â£50,000 or less by creating
a small profits rate maintained

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.970 align:middle line:84%
at the current rate
of 19 per cent.

00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:49.870 align:middle line:84%
This means, around 70
per cent of companies,

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:55.660 align:middle line:84%
1.4m businesses will be
completely unaffected.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And third, we will introduce
a taper above Â£50,000 so that

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.840 align:middle line:84%
only businesses with profits of
a quarter of a million pounds

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:09.940 align:middle line:84%
or greater will be taxed at
the full 25 per cent rate.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:14.050 align:middle line:84%
That means only 10
per cent of companies

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.050 align:middle line:90%
will pay the full higher rate.

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
So yes, it's a tax rise
on company profits,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.320 align:middle line:84%
but only on the larger,
more profitable companies,

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and only in two years' time.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
announce this now,

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.860 align:middle line:84%
because I think for
business, certainty matters.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:43.390 align:middle line:84%
For the next two years, I'm
also making the tax treatment

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:48.520 align:middle line:84%
of losses significantly more
generous by allowing businesses

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:84%
to carry back losses of
up to Â£2m for three years,

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.100 align:middle line:84%
providing a significant
cash flow benefit.

00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:84%
This means companies can now
claim additional tax refunds

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.230 align:middle line:90%
of up to Â£760,000.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:08.260 align:middle line:84%
And because of the current
8 per cent bank surcharge,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
the implied overall tax rate
for banks would be too high.

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So we will review
the surcharge to make

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:84%
sure the combined rate of
tax on the UK banking sector

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't increase significantly
from its current level

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.360 align:middle line:84%
and to make sure this
important industry remains

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:90%
internationally competitive.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, these
are significant decisions

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
to have taken, decisions no
chancellor wants to make.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.590 align:middle line:84%
I recognise they
might not be popular.

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.230 align:middle line:90%
But they are honest.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And let's consider
the alternatives.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:53.910 align:middle line:84%
The first is to do nothing,
to leave our deficit

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.000 align:middle line:84%
problem untreated, our debt
problem for someone else

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:90%
in the future to deal with.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.940 align:middle line:84%
That has never been the way
of a Conservative government.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.040 align:middle line:84%
And nor do I believe
it can be the way

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.800 align:middle line:90%
of a responsible chancellor.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Another alternative
would be to try and find

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:84%
all the savings we need
from public spending.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:84%
But when we said at
the last election

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:84%
that we were the party of public
services, people believed us.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.820 align:middle line:84%
And they were right
to believe us.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we said we'd
be the party that

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.390 align:middle line:84%
invests in new
infrastructure, they

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:90%
were right to believe that too.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.440 align:middle line:84%
The only other alternative would
be to increase the rates of tax

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:90%
on working people.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.050 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe that
would be right either.

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.830 align:middle line:84%
So I believe our
approach, while bold,

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:47.670 align:middle line:84%
is compatible with
our duty as a fiscally

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:51.510 align:middle line:84%
responsible and business
friendly government.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the right
choice, and I'm

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:84%
confident it will
command public assent.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I have one final
announcement on business tax.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:04.770 align:middle line:84%
With the lowest
corporation tax in the G7

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.070 align:middle line:84%
and a new small
profits rate, the UK

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
will have a
pro-business tax regime.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But we need to do
even more to encourage

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:19.230 align:middle line:90%
businesses to invest right now.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:84%
Business investment
creates jobs,

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.800 align:middle line:84%
lifts growth, spurs innovation
and drives productivity.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.990 align:middle line:84%
For decades, we've lagged
behind our international peers.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Right now, while many
businesses are struggling,

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:39.090 align:middle line:84%
others have been able to build
up significant cash reserves.

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.880 align:middle line:84%
We need to unlock
that investment.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We need an
investment-led recovery.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:49.980 align:middle line:84%
So today, I can announce
the super-deduction.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.030 align:middle line:84%
For the next two years,
when companies invest,

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.180 align:middle line:84%
they can reduce their
tax bill, not just

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.240 align:middle line:84%
by a proportion of the cost of
that investment as they do now,

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.620 align:middle line:84%
or even by 100 per
cent of their cost,

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.100 align:middle line:84%
the so-called full expensing
that some have called for.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.030 align:middle line:84%
With the super-deduction, they
can now reduce their tax bill

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:15.420 align:middle line:90%
by 130 per cent of the cost.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.605 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear.

00:33:16.605 --> 00:33:18.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me give the
house an example.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Under the existing rules, a
construction firm buying Â£10m

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:25.800 align:middle line:84%
of new equipment could
reduce their taxable income

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.330 align:middle line:84%
in the year they
invest by just Â£2.6m.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:36.570 align:middle line:84%
With the super-deduction they
can now reduce it by GBP Â£13m.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:84%
We've never tried this
before in our country.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The OBR have said it will boost
business investment by 10 per

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.270 align:middle line:84%
cent, around Â£20bn
more per year.

00:33:48.270 --> 00:33:52.680 align:middle line:84%
It makes our tax regime for
business investment truly world

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:58.614 align:middle line:84%
leading, lifting us from
30th in the OECD to 1st.

00:33:58.614 --> 00:34:03.850 align:middle line:84%
And worth Â£25bn during the
two years that is in place,

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.980 align:middle line:84%
this will be the biggest
business tax cut in modern

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.260 align:middle line:90%
British history.

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Bold, unprecedented
action to get companies

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:20.340 align:middle line:84%
investing, creating jobs, and
driving our economic recovery.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:25.210 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, let
me now turn to duties.

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:28.380 align:middle line:84%
This is a tough time
for hospitality.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:32.400 align:middle line:84%
So I can confirm that the
planned increases in duties

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.480 align:middle line:84%
for spirits like Scotch
whisky, wine, cider,

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.500 align:middle line:90%
and beer will all be cancelled.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.980 align:middle line:84%
All alcohol duties frozen
for the second year

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:48.449 align:middle line:84%
in a row, only the third
time in two decades.

00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:52.300 align:middle line:84%
And right now, to keep
the cost of living low,

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.469 align:middle line:84%
I'm not prepared to increase
the cost of a tank of fuel.

00:34:56.469 --> 00:35:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So the planned increase in
fuel duty is also cancelled.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy
speaker, this budget

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.890 align:middle line:84%
protects the jobs
and livelihoods

00:35:10.890 --> 00:35:12.440 align:middle line:90%
of the British people.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.020 align:middle line:84%
This Budget is honest
about the challenges

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:19.790 align:middle line:84%
facing our public finances and
how we will begin to fix them.

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And this Budget does
one other thing.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:27.060 align:middle line:84%
It lays the foundations
of our future economy,

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.200 align:middle line:90%
the third part of our plan.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If we want a better
future economy,

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:90%
we have to make it happen.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.050 align:middle line:84%
We have to do things that
have never been done before.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:41.390 align:middle line:84%
The world is not
going to be any less

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:44.510 align:middle line:90%
competitive after coronavirus.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:47.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's not enough to
have some general desire

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:49.280 align:middle line:90%
to grow the economy.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.000 align:middle line:84%
We need a real commitment
to green growth.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to have
some general desire

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:90%
to increase productivity.

00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.690 align:middle line:84%
We need a real
commitment to give

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.810 align:middle line:84%
every business, large
or small the opportunity

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:05.340 align:middle line:90%
to grow, innovate, and succeed.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.110 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to have a
general desire to create jobs.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:13.070 align:middle line:84%
We need a real commitment to
create jobs where people are

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:17.270 align:middle line:84%
and change the economic
geography of this country.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And we can't strengthen
our domestic economy

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:24.890 align:middle line:84%
without remaining a global
outward-looking nation.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:29.120 align:middle line:84%
This future economy won't be
created in any one budget.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But today, we lay
the foundations.

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.450 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
our future economy

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:37.280 align:middle line:84%
needs investment
in green industries

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.110 align:middle line:90%
across the United Kingdom.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:42.920 align:middle line:84%
So I can announce today the
first ever UK infrastructure

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.940 align:middle line:90%
bank.

00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Located in Leeds,
the bank will invest

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.180 align:middle line:84%
across the UK in public
and private projects

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.300 align:middle line:84%
to finance the green
industrial revolution.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Beginning this spring, it will
have an initial capitalisation

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.370 align:middle line:90%
of Â£12bn. .

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And we expect it to support at
least Â£40bn of total investment

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:04.040 align:middle line:90%
in infrastructure.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know my right honourable
friend, the member for Pudsey,

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.890 align:middle line:84%
will particularly welcome
the location of this new

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.810 align:middle line:90%
institution.

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.240 align:middle line:84%
Offshore wind is an
innovative industry,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:18.390 align:middle line:84%
where the UK already has a
global competitive advantage.

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're funding new
port infrastructure

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:23.630 align:middle line:84%
to build the next generation
of offshore wind projects

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:26.420 align:middle line:90%
in Teesside and Humberside.

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And in November I
announced we would

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
launch a world-leading
sovereign green bond.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going further,
announcing a new retail savings

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.110 align:middle line:84%
product to give all UK savers
the chance to support green

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:41.270 align:middle line:84%
projects, as my right
honourable friend,

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.970 align:middle line:84%
the member for North East
Bedfordshire has campaigned

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:44.890 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:84%
We've also asked Dame Clara
Furse to establish a new group

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.930 align:middle line:84%
to position the City
as the global leader

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:54.380 align:middle line:84%
for voluntary, high-quality
carbon offset markets.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.600 align:middle line:84%
And underpinning
all of this will

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.180 align:middle line:84%
be an updated monetary policy
remit for the Bank of England.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It reaffirms their
2 per cent target.

00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:06.260 align:middle line:84%
But now, it will also
reflect the importance

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:11.330 align:middle line:84%
of environmental sustainability
and the transition to net zero.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
our future economy

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.430 align:middle line:84%
will also address our
productivity problem

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:90%
and support small business.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:22.130 align:middle line:84%
Too often smaller firms don't
have the time or resources

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.350 align:middle line:84%
to acquire the extra
skills and training

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:27.560 align:middle line:84%
they need to be more efficient,
more digital, and more

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.820 align:middle line:90%
productive.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:32.330 align:middle line:84%
Thanks to Be the Business,
we have made a good start

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.780 align:middle line:90%
at supporting these firms.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.950 align:middle line:84%
Today, the business
secretary and I

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:41.240 align:middle line:84%
are going further with a
new set of UK-wide schemes,

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.160 align:middle line:90%
Help to Grow.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.150 align:middle line:84%
First, Help to Grow Management
will help tens of thousands

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:49.430 align:middle line:84%
of small and
medium-sized businesses

00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:52.190 align:middle line:84%
get world-class
management training.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Dozens of business schools
across the UK will offer a new

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.750 align:middle line:84%
executive development programme
with mentoring and peer

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.320 align:middle line:90%
learning.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.305 align:middle line:84%
And government
will contribute 90

00:39:02.305 --> 00:39:05.870 align:middle line:84%
per cent of the cost,
a real commitment

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:09.680 align:middle line:84%
to learn more, make
more, and earn more.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:90%
Second, Help to Grow Digital.

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.950 align:middle line:84%
With the pandemic many
businesses have moved online.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:17.540 align:middle line:90%
This has been a challenge.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.140 align:middle line:84%
But we want to turn it
into an opportunity.

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.900 align:middle line:84%
We're going to help small
businesses develop digital

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.360 align:middle line:84%
skills by giving them free,
expert training and a 50 per

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.730 align:middle line:84%
cent discount on new
productivity-enhancing software

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:35.210 align:middle line:90%
worth up to Â£5,000 each.

00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Both programmes will
commence by the autumn.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And I'd urge interested
businesses to register today

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:48.830 align:middle line:84%
on gov.uk/helptogrow, a real
commitment to help over 100,000

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.550 align:middle line:84%
businesses become more
innovative, more competitive,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.620 align:middle line:90%
and more profitable.

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
a future economy

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.150 align:middle line:84%
requires us to be
at the forefront

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:03.230 align:middle line:84%
of the next scientific and
technological revolutions.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:07.790 align:middle line:84%
Becoming a scientific superpower
is something we can be.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
hubristic or unrealistic.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Our incredible vaccination
programme has shown the world

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.680 align:middle line:90%
what this country is capable of.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:23.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm providing an extra Â£1.6bn
today to continue the rollout

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and improve our
future preparedness.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make
the UK the best

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:32.590 align:middle line:84%
place in the world for
high-growth innovative

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.790 align:middle line:90%
companies.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So I'm launching two
wide-ranging consultations

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.940 align:middle line:84%
today to make sure our
research and development tax

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.690 align:middle line:84%
relief and our enterprise
management incentives

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.240 align:middle line:90%
are internationally competitive.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And my right honourable
friend, the home secretary,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.870 align:middle line:84%
knows that a scientific
superpower needs scientific

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.160 align:middle line:90%
superstars.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So together, we're announcing
ambitious visa reforms,

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.380 align:middle line:84%
aimed at highly
skilled migrants,

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:03.940 align:middle line:84%
including a new unsponsored
points-based visa

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.630 align:middle line:84%
to attract the best and most
promising international talent

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.380 align:middle line:84%
in science, research, and
tech, new improved visa

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.900 align:middle line:84%
processes for scale
ups and entrepreneurs,

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.780 align:middle line:84%
and radically
simplified bureaucracy

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.870 align:middle line:84%
for high-skilled
visa applications.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, as well as support
for innovation and access

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to talent, high-growth firms
need access to capital.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:30.730 align:middle line:84%
To do that, we're taking steps
to give the pensions industry

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.720 align:middle line:84%
more flexibility to unlock
billions of pounds from pension

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.240 align:middle line:84%
funds into innovative
new ventures,

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.640 align:middle line:84%
launching a new future
fund breakthrough

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.280 align:middle line:84%
to help fill the
scale up funding gap,

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and changing the rules to
encourage more countries,

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.400 align:middle line:90%
more companies to list here.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.690 align:middle line:84%
Let me thank Lord Hill for
leading this landmark review.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:56.515 align:middle line:84%
The FCA will be consulting on
his proposals very shortly.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:04.420 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
our future economy

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:08.320 align:middle line:84%
depends on remaining
a United Kingdom.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.680 align:middle line:84%
Millions of families and
businesses in Scotland, Wales,

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.160 align:middle line:84%
and Northern Ireland
have contributed to

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.090 align:middle line:84%
and benefited from our
coronavirus response.

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And central to that
has been a Treasury

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.970 align:middle line:84%
that acts for the
whole United Kingdom.

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:27.730 align:middle line:90%
That's not a political point.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:30.970 align:middle line:90%
It's an undeniable truth.

00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.910 align:middle line:84%
The majority of
today's Budget measures

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:39.070 align:middle line:84%
will apply directly to people in
all four nations of the United

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:40.300 align:middle line:90%
Kingdom.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking
further specific steps

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:46.900 align:middle line:84%
with three accelerated
Scottish city and growth deals

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:84%
in Ayrshire, Argyll and
Bute, and Falkirk, three more

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.340 align:middle line:84%
in North Wales, Mid
Wales, and Swansea Bay.

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And funding for the
Holyhead Hydrogen Hub,

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.730 align:middle line:84%
the Global Centre of Rail
Excellence in Neath Port

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Talbot, the Aberdeen
Energy Transition Zone,

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:07.570 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Global Underwater
Hub and North Sea Transition

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:12.610 align:middle line:84%
Deal, along with the first
allocations of the Â£400m New

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:14.980 align:middle line:90%
Deal for Northern Ireland.

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And through the Barnett formula,
the decisions I'm taking

00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:21.670 align:middle line:84%
in this Budget also increase
the funding for the devolved

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:29.110 align:middle line:84%
administrations by Â£1.2bn
in Scotland, Â£740m in Wales,

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and Â£410m for the Northern
Ireland executive.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:38.260 align:middle line:84%
And madam deputy speaker,
our future economy

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.640 align:middle line:84%
demands a different
economic geography.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.850 align:middle line:84%
If we are serious about
wanting to level up,

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:50.380 align:middle line:84%
that starts with the
institutions of economic power.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.520 align:middle line:84%
Few institutions are more
powerful than the one

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I am enormously privileged
to lead, the Treasury.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Along with the other critical
economic departments,

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:84%
including BEIS,
DIT, and MHDLG, we

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.390 align:middle line:84%
will establish a new economic
campus in Darlington.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And I know my honourable friend,
the member for Darlington,

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:19.150 align:middle line:84%
will particularly welcome
this announcement.

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Redrawing our economic
map means rebalancing

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:24.580 align:middle line:90%
our economic investment.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:27.700 align:middle line:84%
I have already revised
the Treasury's Green Book

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.830 align:middle line:84%
and set out the highest
sustained levels

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:34.060 align:middle line:84%
of public investment across
the UK since the 1970s.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.500 align:middle line:90%
But we can go further.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I am announcing today over
a billion pounds for 45

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.040 align:middle line:90%
new town's deals.

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.030 align:middle line:84%
From Castleford to Clay Cross,
Rochdale to Rowley Regis,

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.580 align:middle line:90%
and Whitby to Wolverhampton.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:51.100 align:middle line:84%
And let me pay tribute
to local leaders,

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.710 align:middle line:84%
like the brilliant mayor
for the West Midlands, Andy

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:58.010 align:middle line:84%
Street, who are making the case
for investment in their area.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.770 align:middle line:84%
We're also creating a Â£150m
fund to help communities across

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:06.550 align:middle line:84%
the UK take ownership of
pubs, theatres, shops,

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.030 align:middle line:84%
or local sports clubs
at risk of loss,

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.540 align:middle line:84%
putting more power in the
hands of local people.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm launching the first
round of the Levelling Up fund

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.680 align:middle line:84%
today, inviting applications
from local areas

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:23.590 align:middle line:90%
across the United Kingdom.

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful to my
right honourable friends,

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.630 align:middle line:84%
the transport secretary and
the communities secretary

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:34.120 align:middle line:84%
for their support on
this crucial initiative.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker, I
have one final announcement

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.700 align:middle line:84%
that exemplifies the
future economy, a policy

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.130 align:middle line:84%
on a scale we've
never done before,

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.500 align:middle line:84%
a policy to bring
investment trade,

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and most importantly, jobs
right across this country.

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:54.130 align:middle line:84%
To replace the
industries of the past

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:57.790 align:middle line:84%
with green, innovative,
fast-growing new businesses.

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:00.700 align:middle line:84%
To encourage free trade
and reinforce our position

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.450 align:middle line:84%
as an outward looking trading
nation open to the world,

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.210 align:middle line:84%
a policy we can
now only pursue now

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:12.010 align:middle line:84%
that we are out of the
European Union, freeports.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:16.450 align:middle line:84%
Freeports are special economic
zones with different rules

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.290 align:middle line:84%
to make it easier and
cheaper to do business.

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.150 align:middle line:84%
They're well-established
internationally.

00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But we're taking
a unique approach.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Our freeports will
have simpler planning

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.490 align:middle line:84%
to allow businesses to
build, infrastructure

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:34.150 align:middle line:84%
funding to improve transport
links, cheaper customs,

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:38.860 align:middle line:84%
with favourable tariffs, VAT,
or duties, and lower taxes,

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.680 align:middle line:84%
with tax breaks to
encourage construction,

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.710 align:middle line:84%
private investment,
and job creation.

00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:50.290 align:middle line:84%
An unprecedented economic boost
across the United Kingdom.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Freeports will be a
truly UK-wide policy.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And we will work constructively
with the Scottish, Welsh,

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:59.680 align:middle line:84%
and Northern Irish
administration.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, I can announce the
eight freeport locations

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:84%
in England, East Midlands
Airport, Felixstowe

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and Harwich, Humber, Liverpool
City region, Plymouth, Solent,

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.190 align:middle line:90%
Thames, and Teeside.

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Eight new freeports in
eight English regions,

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:25.600 align:middle line:84%
unlocking billions of pounds
of private sector investment,

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.860 align:middle line:84%
generating trade and jobs
up and down the country.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.710 align:middle line:84%
I commend members
from across the house

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.090 align:middle line:90%
for their campaigning.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:38.020 align:middle line:84%
But in particular, the
honourable members for Redcar,

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Cleethorpes, and Great Grimsby,
as well as inspiring local

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:45.782 align:middle line:84%
leaders, like Ben Houchen,
the mayor Tees Valley.

00:47:45.782 --> 00:47:47.320 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.560 align:middle line:84%
Madam Deputy Speaker,
let's take just one

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.260 align:middle line:90%
of those places, Teeside.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:56.860 align:middle line:84%
In the past, it was
known for its success

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.260 align:middle line:90%
in industries like steel.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I look to
the future of Teeside,

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:06.370 align:middle line:84%
I see old industrial sites
being used to capture

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and store carbon, vaccines
being manufactured,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.880 align:middle line:84%
offshore wind turbines,
creating clean energy

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.610 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of the
country, all located

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:17.710 align:middle line:84%
within a freeport
with the Treasury

00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:20.740 align:middle line:84%
just down the road and
a UK infrastructure bank

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.200 align:middle line:90%
only an hour away.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I see innovative, fast-growing
businesses hiring local people

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:30.490 align:middle line:84%
into decent
well-paid green jobs.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I see people designing,
manufacturing,

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:36.950 align:middle line:84%
and exporting incredible
new products and services.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.610 align:middle line:84%
I see people putting
down roots in places

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:42.250 align:middle line:90%
they are proud to call home.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.990 align:middle line:84%
I see a people optimistic and
ambitious for their future.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:50.230 align:middle line:84%
That, madam deputy speaker,
is the future economy

00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:51.400 align:middle line:90%
of this country.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.180 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, whilst
this last year has

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:05.830 align:middle line:84%
been a test unlike any other,
that which we are, we are.

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The fundamentals of our
character as a people

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.560 align:middle line:90%
have not changed.

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:16.960 align:middle line:84%
Still determined, still
generous, still fair,

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.360 align:middle line:84%
that's what got us
through the last year.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:24.040 align:middle line:84%
It's what will guide us through
the next decade and beyond.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:28.570 align:middle line:84%
This time last year, we set
out to deliver on the promises

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.660 align:middle line:90%
we made to the British people.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:34.660 align:middle line:84%
But the most important
promise was implicit

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and in truth, is made
by every government

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.030 align:middle line:90%
irrespective of their politics.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And that is to do
what must be done

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:47.120 align:middle line:84%
when the danger is imminent
and when no one else can.

00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:50.320 align:middle line:84%
Today, we set out
a plan to protect

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:54.010 align:middle line:84%
the jobs and livelihoods
of the British people.

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:56.830 align:middle line:84%
But the promises that
underpin that plan

00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:00.640 align:middle line:84%
remain unchanged from
those we pledged ourselves

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:08.290 align:middle line:84%
to 12 long months ago, to
unite and lead, to level up,

00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:11.380 align:middle line:84%
to create a world-class
education system,

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:84%
to keep our streets safe,
to keep our NHS strong,

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.730 align:middle line:84%
to support the most vulnerable,
to reform and improve

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:23.050 align:middle line:84%
public services, to grow the
economy, to spread prosperity,

00:50:23.050 --> 00:50:26.020 align:middle line:84%
to extend the awesome
power of opportunity

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.710 align:middle line:84%
to all corners of the
United Kingdom, and yes,

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:34.390 align:middle line:84%
to be honest and fair
in all that we do.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:37.780 align:middle line:84%
Madam deputy speaker,
an important moment

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:42.490 align:middle line:84%
is upon us, a moment of
challenge and of change.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Of difficulties, yes,
but of possibilities too.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.650 align:middle line:84%
This is a Budget that
meets that moment,

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and I commend it to the House.

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:55.020 align:middle line:90%
Hear, hear, hear.
